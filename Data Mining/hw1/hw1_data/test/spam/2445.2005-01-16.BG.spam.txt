news release :
delray beach , fla . , jan . 14 / prnewswire - firstcall /
millennium national events : mnei today announced that
it has entered into an exclusive agreement with
sign - a - rama , giving the sign giant ' s 700 stores
in 35 countries the benefit of millennium ' s preferred
vendor status with img , sfx and clear channel , and
its access to over 5000 events worldwide .
millennium ' s strength exists in its ability to produce
one of the most robust and diverse schedules of events
using all venues for concerts , sporting events , festivals
and trade shows , " said mitchell steinberg , chairman
and coo of millennium .
" consolidating our signage consumption under one umbrella
with a company that has the scope and vision of
sign - a - rama will mean tremendous economy of scale
purchasing power to us and will yield significant
additional margin for both of our companies , " added
steinberg .
industry estimates suggest that the expense budget on
signage for events in 2004 ran to approximately one
billion dollars worldwide .
the alliance with sign - a - rama will bring value - added
benefits to millennium , with sign - a - rama shops throughout
the world acting as " printing and graphics divisions "
of the company . added steinberg , " it allows us to
outsource , which is key to streamlining operations ,
the added bonus being that we maintain control and
confidence in execution . we know sign - a - rama shops
have the ability to get the job done , just about
anywhere in the world . instead of being one more thing
to worry about , it becomes one more solid building
block in millennium ' s ability to be a turnkey event
promoter worldwide . "
ray titus , president of both sign - a - rama and embroidme ,
added , " we see this affiliation with millennium as a
natural extension for both of our franchise companies ,
sign - a - rama and embroidme . the signage and embroidery
business is a perfect complement to any , and all ,
events , and we are extremely excited about the positive
impact this will have for our family of franchise owners .
