but , i spent the next three weeks making a piece of simple software for her son to her specifications . while i was at it , i put 4 - 8 pictures on the screen as well . the simple program was finished and ready for her child to see . as i was presenting it , the other children in my classroom were pushing each other to get to the computer screen to touch that touch window and hear the word spoken again and again . i looked at these kids and was amazed . there was no music , no animation , nothing cute about this program at all , just real pictures with real words . i was stunned . i just watched the children . within 10 minutes , several children who had never said a word in their life , made approximations of several words . i was hooked . .
