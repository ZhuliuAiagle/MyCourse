Subject: re : culture committee next steps
louise ,
i think that shelley corman would be best suited to run the sub - committee during your maternity leave . i think that i am perceived as too commercial focused ( with emphasis on the associate / analyst program ) and in addition , her representation of et & s would balance the leadership of the other sub - committees .
besides , i think you know i will be active participant regardless of my assigned role .
regards , jean
