ian ,
sorry for a delay in responding to you .
i am currently in london , flying back to houston tomorrow .
the problem is not with the lawyers . we worked on our presentation
materials together with a professor from another university
and we agreed to use these materials only internally .
we have to honor our commitment to him . i am sure
that this is exactly what you would have expected from us if we had
made a similar commitment to you .

what do i need to do to move this thing forward ?
i suspect that the problem is basically with the lawyers . they only know
how to stop things , but in a way they play a role in global society . if it
were not for the handicaps they lay on us the rest of the world would never
have a chance .

ian ,
sorry for a delay in getting back to you .
i have one challenge i did not anticipate
when i talked to you the first time about our real options
internal seminar .
the materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school , and there is some sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
materials
outside enron .
please , give me some time to find out if i can work
around this issue .
