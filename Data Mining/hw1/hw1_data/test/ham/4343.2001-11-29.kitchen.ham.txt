daschle calls for congressional investigation of enron collapse
2001 - 11 - 29 12 : 30 ( new york )
washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - following are comments
made this morning by senate majority leader tom daschle when asked
about the collapse of enron corp . :
` ` we ' re certainly going to try to find answers to
the questions involving the collapse of enron . i don ' t know that
anybody knows yet just how this happened and how it happened so
quickly .
` ` i think we need to find as much information as is possible
and make some assessment about whether it ' s indicative of energy
in a larger context and if it is , what we ought to do about it .
but clearly it raises some very serious questions . ' '
enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed

enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed
houston , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - trammell crow co . delayed
construction of a $ 108 million office development in downtown
houston , the first real estate project in the city to suffer the
fallout from enron ' s financial troubles .
trammell crow delayed groundbreaking on the planned 34 - story
tower until at least next year , said leah rogers , a trammell crow
spokeswoman . construction was to have started next week .
` ` given the national economic uncertainty and the uncertainty
associated with the future availability of class ` a ' space
springing from the recent events at enron , we have decided to
delay our construction start until future visibility improves , ' '
matt khourie , who heads trammell crow ' s houston development
operations , said in a statement .
enron , the largest u . s . energy trader , may have to file for
bankruptcy protection and liquidate assets after dynegy inc .
abandoned its proposed purchase of the company , investors and
analysts said . with enron expected to give most of the 3 million
square feet it occupies in houston , developers will have a harder
time filling projects , forcing rental rates down , brokers said .
about 2 million square feet of enron ' s space is in the city ' s
downtown , where trammell crow ' s ballpark place project was
planned . the project was to include apartments and retail space ,
and sit next to enron field , home to the major league baseball
team houston astros , according to the houston chronicle , which
reported the delay earlier .
houston has 4 projects under construction , including a 40 -
story , 1 . 17 - million - square - foot tower being built by enron next to
its current headquarters . the projects are mainly being built for
power companies , said peyton collins , head of property broker
insignia / esg ' s houston office .
` ` the downtown market is 5 percent vacant and if you look
five years out , with all the space that ' s coming in line , vacancy
rates could double , ' ' said collins .
other houston office projects underway include an 800 , 000 -
square - foot building in which reliant resources will lease 550 , 000
square feet , and a 600 , 000 - square - foot tower , half of which will
be occupied by calpine corp . , according to insignia .

newpower has enough cash to run through 2 nd quarter ( updatel )
( updates with financing details in second paragraph and
enron ' s third - quarter loss on investments in sixth paragraph . )
purchase , new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - newpower holdings
inc . , a venture formed by enron corp . to compete with traditional
natural - gas and electric utilities , said it has enough cash and
credit to run through the second quarter .
the company is negotiating with lenders for $ 50 million for
next year and another $ 50 million in 2003 , spokeswoman gael doar
said . newpower , 44 percent owned by enron , may need money to buy
gas for winter inventories next year , she said .
newpower said a possible enron bankruptcy filing probably
won ' t affect its earnings . the purchase , new york - based company
said it can meet its credit obligations to enron and utilities and
will continue to deliver to customers .
newpower had 805 , 000 customers at the end of the third
quarter and said it expects to have 840 , 000 to 860 , 000 by the end
of the year . most electricity customers are in texas . georgia is
its largest gas market , doar said . it also has business in ohio ,
pennsylvania and elsewhere .

the biggest energy trader , after standard i ' m sure i can expect some of
that sort of stuff but nothing yet today . i ' m sure they ' ve got
other things to think about . ' '

nymex tells members enron trades must be approved ( updatel )
( adds margin increases in fourth - fifth paragraphs . )
new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - new york mercantile exchange
president j . robert collins told floor members they could not
accept orders from enron corp . unless they receive written
authorization from an exchange clearing member .
a fax from collins to member firms today said the order was
effective immediately and that it would ` ` remain in effect until
further notice from the exchange . ' '
clearing members are companies that guarantee transactions on
the exchange , which trades energy and metals futures and options .
the exchange yesterday said it will raise margins on its
natural gas and crude oil futures contracts at the close of
trading today . margins are deposits traders must make with the
exchange when buying or selling futures contracts to ensure
obligations will be met .
while the exchange gave no reason for the increase , the
decision followed a day of wide changes in natural gas prices . the
swings began after dynegy inc . abandoned plans to purchase enron ,
once the biggest gas trader . traders grew concerned that enron
might be forced into bankruptcy .
enron metals close to finding a buyer , administrators say
2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york )
enron metals close to finding a buyer , administrators say
london , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s metals unit , one
of the biggest traders on the london metal exchange , is close to
being sold , its administrator said , an accord that would end an 18 -
month foray into markets for copper and similar products .
possible buyers include hsbc holdings plc , glencore
international ag and the current management of the company ,
traders and analysts speculated . officials at the companies
couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment .
` ` there is already very serious interest in enron ' s metal
business , and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful
deal ' ' soon , said tony lomas , a pricewaterhousecoopers
administrator for enron in europe . ` ` our primary focus will be on
the large physical assets and trading position of the group . ' '
traders and analysts have speculated that enron metals would
be sold since dynegy inc . agreed earlier this month to buy enron
corp . for $ 23 billion . after that accord collapsed yesterday , the
metals unit seemed slated for a sale , analysts said .
enron agreed to buy the business , formerly mg plc , for $ 445
million in may of last year . mg itself was the metals - trading unit
of germany ' s metallgesellschaft ag and a century - old operation
upon which that german construction , engineering and trading
company was built .
it is one of just 11 floor traders on the london metal
exchange , the world ' s biggest metals bourse . enron earned
commissions though brokering trades there , charged rent at its
warehouses owned by henry bath & son ltd . and speculated on the
direction of metals prices .
declining market
the former chief executive of metallgesellschaft , heinz
schimmelbusch , in an interview earlier this month denied
speculation that his pennsylvania - based safeguard international
fund lp was interested in buying enron or any metals - trading
operation .
hsbc , europe ' s biggest bank by market value , said last month
it ' s considering a plan to add trading of industrial metals such
as copper and aluminum to its precious - metals trading operation to
meet demand from its customers .
any interest from glencore may stem from its desire to expand
its existing operations , said mike price , head of mining and
metals at societe generale , which is itself a so - called ring
dealer , or floor trader , on the lme .
whoever buys enron metals ` ` has to be somebody pretty
substantial , ' ' price said . if the current management hopes to be
the buyer , ` ` they would need to find somebody with deep pockets . ' '
the new owner of enron metals will be entering the metals
market at a time when copper prices have declined 15 percent this
year and aluminum prices are 7 percent down as demand dropped from
users such as aircraft makers and electronics companies amid
slowing economies .
the declining prices have led n . m . rothschild & sons , a
member of the lme , to quit base metals trading and prompted
scotiamoccata , a metals - trading unit of canada ' s bank of nova
scotia to leave the lme ring .
the departure of scotiamoccata reduced the number of ring
dealers to 11 and raised doubts about the future of open - outcry
trading at the exchange . the lme is promoting less - expensive
electronic trading .
german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million
2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york )
german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million
frankfurt , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - dresdner bank ag , which is
owned by allianz ag , said its exposure to enron corp . is about
$ 100 million .
deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag said their exposure to
enron amounts to a ` ` double - digit ' ' million euros amount .
europe ' s largest bank has an exposure ` ` significantly ' ' below
100 million euros ( $ 89 million ) , said ronald weichert , a spokesman
for deutsche bank .
commerzbank ' s exposure is more than 10 million euros and less
than 50 million euros , spokesman peter pietsch said .
dresdner expects ` ` way less ' ' than $ 100 million to default ,
and will take the appropriate loan loss reserves at the end of the
year , said spokeswoman elke pawellek .
the largest u . s . energy trader , may file for bankruptcy
protection after dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed
merger with enron , forcing enron to liquidate assets to pay some
of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt .
enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case
2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 04 ( new york )
enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case
washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is poised to
file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history after dynegy
inc . scuttled plans to acquire the energy trader that is saddled
with more than $ 15 billion in debt .
enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week ,
must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is
responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated
partnerships .
the houston - based company ' s collapse was underscored by new
restrictions on its operations . the new york mercantile exchange
barred floor members from accepting orders from enron without
special written authorization , and the company ' s internet trading
was reduced from about 30 commodities to three products .
a bankruptcy filing by enron would top texaco inc . ' s record
$ 35 . 9 billion case in 1987 , with creditors lining up to claim
what ' s left of the company ' s more than $ 61 billion in assets .
` ` it ' s a black hole , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of
deltec asset management llc , which has no investment in enron .
` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things
out , you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth . ' '
duke energy corp . , j . p . morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and
a dozen other companies say they may lose more than $ 1 billion
combined from enron ' s collapse . electricity and natural gas
companies said enron owed them almost $ 600 million as of
yesterday .
in london , was appointed administrator
of enron ' s european holding company and some of its operating
companies , a step other companies have taken before filing chapter
11 papers in the u . s .
enron shares have lost more than $ 26 billion in market value
in the last six months .
lawyers
enron has hired the law firm weil gotshal & manges llp , which
has the nation ' s largest bankruptcy practice , and the blackstone
group lp investment banking firm . arthur newman , head of
restructuring at blackstone , said his firm was retained but
declined to comment further .
chapter 11 would let enron officials continue to control the
company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . a
provision of u . s . bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt -
collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the
company .
` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved
company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean
of the university of houston law center .
thousands affected
an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people ,
including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers ,
suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised
recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies
and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in
the company ' s liquidation .
in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a
nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns
portland general electric , which generates and distributes power
to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s
enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic
communications network .
chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous
contracts and unprofitable leases .
` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away
from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also
publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations .
recovery
the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a
company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan
typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing
two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a
bankruptcy judge for final approval .
the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various
classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy
code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their
claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as
bondholders and suppliers .
financial advisers to creditors and companies in large
bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be
particularly difficult to produce .
` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass
of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a
bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard &
zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for
advice by enron bondholders .
shareholders
enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their
investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line
to get paid .
enron shares fell 20 cents , or 33 percent , to 41 cents in
afternoon trading . the shares traded at $ 54 . 54 on june 4 . the
company said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a
scheduled 12 . 5 - cent quarterly dividend on dec . 20 .
enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty about the
company ' s value . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in
2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said .
at that price the notes yield 53 percent .
some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may
come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker
with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for
advice by enron bondholders .
` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky .
potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers
and directors .
` ` disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization is going
to be a painstaking job , ' ' he said .
liability
dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase
of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave
it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the
takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in
exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco
corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy .
enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking
away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline .
the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was
proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5
billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the
lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s
decision .
bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b .
lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors
turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be
able to pay its debts .
three credit - rating agencies yesterday cut enron ' s credit
rating to junk status , triggering an acceleration of the company ' s
debt obligations .
unraveling
enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said
shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the
way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the
announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s .
securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating
earnings for almost five years .
as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence
the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners
such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or
restricted trading with the company .
` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s
going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up
being an unsecured creditor tomorrow . ' '
enron ' s overseas assets could complicate bankruptcy

dow jones emerging markets report
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - ( dow jones ) - as enron corp . ( ene ) teeters on the edge of insolvency , its creditors , power industry players and even foreign governments are angling to lay claim to the company ' s assets .
in an example of how far the ripples are being felt , the brazilian government said thursday it ' s legally entitled to seize enron ' s assets in that country if the u . s . energy titan files for bankruptcy .
the houston - based company has more than $ 60 billion in assets , a little more than 10 % of which are considered " non - core " or located overseas . indeed , of enron ' s 10 , 453 megawatts in total power production , 8339 mw are generated internationally .
as it established a presence in dozens of countries , enron also diversified into oil and gas exploration and production , power generation , and even non - energy related businesses such as forest products , metals and steel , broadband and credit evaluation systems .
although enron ' s non - core and global forays haven ' t on the whole been profitable , there is value in some of the hard assets .
and while it ' s not clear whether or how claims by foreign governments on enron assets would be honored , it ' s certain the company ' s myriad overseas holdings will further addle what would likely be a vastly complex bankruptcy proceeding .
the following is an overview of a number of those holdings outside the north american continent , according to some of the most recent data provided by the company , which didn ' t , however , specify the extent of its equity interests or operational control in the majority of the assets listed .
approximately 70 % of enron ' s assets outside north america and europe are located in central and south america and the caribbean :
- - - brazil : enron controls electricity distributor elektro eletricidade e servico sa ( e . eko ) , which was acquired in 1998 for brrl . 479 billion ( $ 1 = brr 2 . 48 ) . it also owns two gas - fired thermoelectric plants : eletrobolt , with a capacity of 380 megawatts , and cuiaba , with a 480 - mw capacity .
enron also owns important stakes in natural gas distributor companhia distribuidora de gas do rio de janeiro ( e . cdr ) , or ceg , and its smaller unit ceg - rio .
in late april , brazil ' s oil giant petroleo brasileiro ( pbr ) , or petrobras , agreed to pay $ 240 million for the stake enron owns in ceg . petrobras agreed to buy the 25 . 38 % stake the u . s . energy group owns in ceg as well as the 33 . 75 % stake enron has in ceg - rio . the deal is still seen closing in the next few days .
- - - puerto rico : enron has been poised to sell in the weeks ahead a 49 % interest in the 507 mw ecoelectrica power plant and liquified natural gas terminal for about $ 250 million .
it ' s also involved in a 20 , 000 metric ton liquefied petroleum gas storage terminal and the san juan gas distribution company , which has a capacity to carry approximately 400 , 000 cubic feet a day .
- - - bolivia : enron is an operator on the bolivian side of the 3 , 000 kilometer bolivia - to - brazil natural gas pipeline , and holds a small 4 % interest on the brazilian side .
- - - argentina : enron has an interest in transportadora de gas del sur , a 5 , 005 kilometer pipeline .
- - - venezuela : enron , in cooperation with vengas , is involved in a leading transporter and distributor of lpg , among other assets .
- - - colombia : enron has stakes in the centragas pipeline , a 578 km natural gas transmission system , and promigas , a top natural gas company .
- - - panama : enron holds a 355 mw electricity generation plant .
- - - guatemala : enron has two power plants with combined generating capacity of 234 mw .
- - - dominican republic : enron has a 185 mw power facility .
the company also has a sizeable footprint in asia , particularly in india :
- - - india : about 14 % of enron ' s international assets are located in india , home to its mammoth $ 3 billion dabhol power project , which has a generation capacity of 2184 mw .
enron is also poised to sell its offshore india oil 201 - 938 - 2226 ; charles . roth @ dowjones . com

usa : ice electronic energy trade soars on enron woes .
11 / 29 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 29 ( reuters ) - the intercontinental exchange ( ice ) , an atlanta - based electronic energy and metals marketplace , said on thursday that trade on its system in late november was up 65 percent from october .
ice has been setting new trading records in recent weeks , as concerns over energy trader enron corp . ' s crumbling credit rating diverted on - line business to the exchange .
enron suspended operations of enrononline , ice ' s main rival for internet - based trading , on wednesday after standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating to " junk " status , killing a potential takeover by dynegy inc . .
enron , which said it has no plans to permanently dismantle its electronic trading system , said it reopened enrononline thursday to allow parties to unwind outstanding positions .
until this month , enron was by far the nation ' s largest trader in north american natural gas and electricity , with industry analysts estimating it was involved in some 25 percent of all daily trade in those markets .
in addition to increased volumes , ice has also seen a big jump in the number of users tapping into the system , up 30 percent from october , the exchange said in a statement .
" over the past couple of weeks we have experienced an increase in total volumes and registered users , " said jeffrey sprecher , chief executive officer of ice .
" we believe the inherent credit concerns in the otc ( over - the - counter ) market have spawned interest in a many - to - many trading platform as opposed to a one - to - many platform .
sprecher also said ice would continue to look for ways to expand its trading platform to accommodate new participants .
as an open - access marketplace , intercontinental exchange now has over 400 commodity trading firms participating .
the ice electronic trading system is now installed on over 7 , 500 desktops worldwide , a 7 percent gain in the past two weeks .
products traded on ice include natural gas , power , crude oil and refined products , precious metals and emissions allowances .
intercontinental exchange has offices in new york , houston , chicago , london and singapore and is owned by over 100 energy and metals traders , brokers and bankers .

new york , nov 29 ( reuters ) - u . s . benchmark 10 - year notes soared more than a full point on thursday as a broad treasury market rally on hopes for another federal reserve rate cut extended amid concerns the beleaguered energy - trading company enron will soon file for bankruptcy .
enron corp . stood at the abyss of bankruptcy on thursday , as its european arm filed for creditor protection and creditors assessed their exposure to one of the world ' s biggest - ever corporate collapses .
" it looks like enron is going to file bankruptcy , " said jim claire , head of fixed income trading at evergreen institutional asset management in charlotte , north carolina . " this is kind of a flight to quality . "
an early report showing a spike in weekly jobless claims in the past week highlighted the frail u . s . economy , boosting market expectations that the fed will cut interest rates for the 11 th time this year at its policy meeting on december 11 .
at 1 : 13 p . m . ( 1813 gmt ) , two - year notes were up 8 / 32 to 100 - 1 / 32 , yielding 2 . 96 percent . five - year notes climbed 22 / 32 to 97 - 3 / 32 , yielding 4 . 15 percent . benchmark 10 - year notes were up 30 / 32 to 101 - 14 / 32 , yielding 4 . 81 percent . thirty - year bonds were up 1 - 15 / 32 to 101 - 24 / 32 , yielding 5 . 26 percent .

us power , gas markets remain orderly despite enron exit

new york - ( dow jones ) - trading in u . s . natural gas and electricity markets generally remained orderly thursday , and price movements continued to be muted , despite the exit of one - time market leader enron corp . ( ene ) .
some gas markets , however , saw more volatility as a result of enron ' s absence , traders said , and some electricity prices seemed stronger than justified by fundamentals , perhaps a result of buying by traders covering their exposure to enron . the moves weren ' t dramatic .
" it ' s almost business as usual , " one power trader said .
enron wasn ' t presenting a full range of prices on its internet - based platform enrononline thursday , although traders said enron was briefly making markets for some products .
traders , who for the most part aren ' t doing business with the company , attributed the activity to last - minute efforts by some energy companies to flatten their positions with enron and the energy giant ' s own efforts to close its positions .
" there ' s a lot of unwinding going on , " a trader said .
the new york mercantile exchange , the world ' s largest energy futures exchange , advised its floor members thursday morning not to accept orders placed directly to the trading floor by enron or enron affiliates without written authorization from a clearing member carrying an enron account .
the exit of a company that once accounted for a quarter of the north american power and gas markets has produced substantial changes in the way business is done in the energy markets .
traders used to transacting on enrononline were spending more time on the phone or turning to platforms like that run by , an electronic marketplace founded by a consortium of energy and financial companies . traders accustomed to looking to enrononline for pricing guidance were left to figure out the market for themselves .
the result was abnormally high volatility in the physical gas markets , particularly on gas for delivery in the next month , a trader said .
gas for delivery in december at southern california ' s topak hub was trading in a range of $ 1 . 95 to $ 2 . 55 per million british thermal units , the trader said . december gas at the san juan basin was trading at $ 1 . 70 - $ 2 . 44 .
" traders aren ' t sure where they should be trading , " the trader said .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
san francisco , nov 29 ( reuters ) - beleaguered energy giant enron corp . said on thursday it had reopened its widely used electronic trading system to allow parties to unwind outstanding positions .
the company also said it has no plans to permanently dismantle its enrononline ( eol ) system , which until this month was by far the most liquid marketplace for trading north american electricity and natural gas .
" enrononline is now available to our customers to transact only in order to provide a means to manage enron credit exposure , " a message posted on the trading system said .
the message warned that " while transactions may be available , customers entering into transactions should carefully evaluate their positions and enron ' s current credit status before transacting . "
enron spokesman eric thode confirmed enrononline - which recently accounted for up to 60 percent of enron ' s business - restarted operations late wednesday .
the internet - based eol trading platform was shut earlier wednesday after credit rating agencies cut enron ' s debt to " junk " status .
thode also said the company had " no plans " to cease operations on enrononline after parties have closed all outstanding positions .
the system also carries products for trading various commodities like metals , pulp and paper .

frankfurt , nov 29 ( reuters ) - german electricity prices jumped around widely on thursday , while year 2002 firmed by up to 35 eurocents due to uncertainty over the value of long - term contracts with crisis - hit counterparty enron .
enron ' s liquidity crisis reached a head on thursday when the firm announced that its european arm had filed for creditor protection .
" prices were jumpy today , which was in part due to uncertainty with enron , " a trader said .
" but enron has actually been tapering off its volumes further out for a while now , so the market didn ' t really miss any big volumes from them today , " he added .
day ahead baseload traded at 31 . 5 - 33 euros , with an early high of 35 euros and a mid - session low of 29 . 5 euros , while peakload traded at 39 . 75 - 42 . 25 euros , after peaking at 45 euros and troughing at 39 . 75 euros .
week ahead was rangebound at 29 . 75 - 31 euros , while peakload changed hands at 41 . 5 - 44 euros in quiet trading .
december baseload traded at 27 . 6 euros , before retracing to its wednesday range of 26 . 65 - 26 . 7 euros , while january baseload traded at 26 . 65 - 27 . 1 , also steady with previous levels .
year 2002 firmed to 22 . 75 from 22 . 4 euros , before falling back down to 22 . 45 and last traded at 22 . 35 - 55 .
" this was all on speculation about enron and on covering their long - term postions since delivery is now not guaranteed beyond friday , " a dealer said .

berlin - ( dow jones ) - while some european mutual funds may be stuck holding enron inc . ( ene ) shares or bonds , their exposure appears fairly limited , with a number of fund companies saying they already sold off their holdings in recent months .
nevertheless , a few funds said they had some exposure in stock or bonds to the company , which stopped most trading wednesday after standard & poor ' s downgraded its credit rating to " junk " and dynegy inc . ( dyn ) abandoned plans for a buyout .
fund manger helle bendorff with bg invest in copenhagen said at the end of october , bg invest ' s international corporate bond fund had 6 . 1 million kroner , or 3 . 2 % , invested in enron corporate bonds , out of a total fund of dkkl 95 million ( $ 1 = dkk 8 . 3652 ) .
" naturally when something like this happens anyone can see it will take its toll on returns , " said bendorff . however , she wouldn ' t give further details .
enron ' s 4 3 / 8 bonds dated 2005 were trading around 20 cents to the dollar thursday , down from over 50 cents before the buyout fell through . the collapse of the dynegy deal leaves enron bondholders holding about $ 13 billion in debt versus an unknown base of assets .
analysts widely expect enron to file for insolvency protection , and its liquidation value will be the focus for bondholders . bondholders are therefore more likely to get something back than investors who are left holding stocks .
in contrast with u . s . counterparts , most european stock funds ' exposure appears fairly low , however , and any hit to their value was probably already taken in the last months .
fund managers and spokespeople at a number of european fund houses that had been known to have holdings in enron shares in the past said they sold off those assets in recent months and weeks .
a spokesman at dutch funds company ohra beleggingen beheer bv said the fund sold its enron holdings at the end of october . they had comprised around 4 . 7 % of its eur 20 million new energy fund and were also included in some other funds , according to funds tracking company morningstar . he said they took a loss on the investment , but stressed they still unwound their holdings on time .
a fund manager at denmark ' s uni - invest said the firms electronic business unit trust had sold off its holdings in enron prior to the current troubles . as of the end of september the unit trust had held 3 . 6 % of its assets in enron stock . the size of the unit trust is dkk 585 million , the manager said .
dresdner bank ' s dit funds arm also sold off all its enron holdings in its energie fonds after the company ' s third - quarter earnings report , a spokesman said , as did ubs ' ag ' s ef - energy fund .
european energy funds tend to be rather small , so even if the fund is highly exposed , it ' s unlikely to have any market impact . the largest energy funds are only several hundred million euros , for example .
in the u . s . , the picture was somewhat different .
enron may have been held by some major u . s . funds , according to the funds ' most recent securities and exchange commission filings . those include fmr corp . ' s ( x . fin ) fidelity investments , stilwell financial inc . ' s ( sv ) janus capital corp . , alliance capital management ( ac ) and putnam investments . vanguard group inc . ( x . vgi ) held the stock in various portfolios , including its giant passively managed index funds , according to its filings .
the $ 11 billion alliance premier growth fund had about 4 % of its assets in enron shares as of sept . 30 , according to morningstar . based on the sept . 30 filing , the fund ' s stake had dropped in value by about $ 445 million through wednesday . a spokeswoman for janus said the company ' s mercury fund , which had 3 . 6 % of its assets invested in enron stock on april 30 , had disposed of all its enron shares by mid - november .
many of the stock funds in europe that are still holding enron funds also reduced their weightings considerably in recent months , according to their representatives .
a spokesman for u . k . - based investec said the company is still holding some enron stock , but wouldn ' t give specific data . morningstar listed the global privatization fund and the wired index fund as holders of enron stock , but investec ' s web site doesn ' t list the funds in the top 10 holdings .
" our enron positions in each of these funds is less than 3 % - it ' s a non - material exposure . we cut our loss positions about two months ago , and we were underweight even before that for a year now , " he said . " the wired index fund tracks the wired index ( a u . s . new - economy index ) and enron is a constituent of that , so our holding is the constituent portion . "

enron metals trading staff say bnp , coke metals , hsbc rumoured possible buyers

( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - enron corp ' s metal trading division has sparked some interest from potential buyers with rumours from the company ' s own trading floor putting bnp paribas , coke metals group , hsbc banking group and goldman sachs & co inc in the frame , an enron metals trader said .
he added that employees have not yet received any information from management on the future of the troubled energy giant following news from london this morning that enron ' s european office has gone into administration .
" everybody showed up for work today , it ' s still a working entity but we ' ve had no word , no internal memos as yet , " the employee told afx news . " we ' re completely in the dark . "
according to reports , an official from administrator has said there is strong interest in the company ' s metals trading division , sparking speculation within the company of potential acquirers , he said .
parties rumoured to be interested in acquiring the division include bnp paribas , coke metals , hsbc and goldman sachs .
" enron still has a membership of the london metals exchange which is of interest to banks who want to get back into the business , " said the employee , who requested anonymity .
" it ' s not the only asset that would be of interest though . the pipeline and fact that ( enron ) has warehousing should be worth hundreds of millions of dollars . "
enron , which employs a total of 21 , 000 people , has been flooded with phone calls all morning from customers seeking information on the company ' s plans .
" for now , we ' re still optimistic that a solution will be found and we won ' t lose our jobs , " said the employee .
analysts are expecting enron to file for bankruptcy protection after dynegy inc yesterday terminated their merger agreement and the company ' s ratings were reduced to junk status .
the stock , which lost 85 pct of its value yesterday , has been forced out of the s & p 500 .

usa : dynegy cites deterioration in enron operations .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 29 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . chairman and chief executive chuck watson on thursday said disclosures by enron corp . of further deterioration in its operations led dynegy to pull out of a deal to acquire the beleaguered energy trading giant and keep it afloat .
a nov . 19 filing with regulators showed that enron faced insurmountable problems both in the long term and the short term , causing dynegy to invoke " material adverse change " clauses allowing it to pull out of its agreement to acquire enron , watson said in an interview with cnbc television .
announcements on wednesday by credit - rating agencies that they had downgraded enron debt to junk status also played a key role in dynegy ' s decision , he said .
watson said dynegy is confident that it will take control of enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline unit next month under a clause of the acquisition agreement that allowed it to keep the 16 , 500 miles of pipeline if the deal collapsed .
enron has said it will contest dynegy ' s claim to the pipeline .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , nov 29 ( reuters ) - u . s . senate majority leader tom daschle said on thursday that congress should find out what brought one - time energy giant enron corp . to the brink of bankruptcy , and see if it has broader ramifications for the energy industry .
" we certainly need to try to find answers to the questions involving the collapse of enron , " the south dakota democrat told reporters .
" i think we need to find as much information as possible , and make some assessments of whether it ' s indicative of energy in the larger context and if it is , what we ought to do about it . but clearly , it raises some very serious questions , " daschle said .
activity at many enron units in more than 40 countries around the world ground to a halt this week . the global giant employs 21 , 000 people in operations ranging from marketing electricity and natural gas to delivering commodities such as metals , coal , pulp and paper .
house energy and commerce committee chairman billy tauzin said on wednesday he did not see a way for the government to try to rescue enron , which was near collapse after rival energy trader dynergy inc . pulled out of a deal to buy it .
" i can ' t right now envision anything the government can do , other than encourage the parties who are discussing a merger to continue their efforts , " said tauzin , a louisiana republican .

enron crisis hits four japanese money mgmt funds - nikkei

tokyo ( nikkei ) - - the reverberations of the crisis at u . s . energy trading giant enron corp . are starting to shake japanese investors , the nihon keizai shimbun reported in its friday morning edition .
with enron now on the edge of bankruptcy , money management funds managed by nikko asset management co . and three other fund companies fell below their par value of yl 0 , 000 thursday due to losses on enron bonds .
the money management funds have apparently fallen 0 . 5 % to 7 % under par value , a significant loss of principal given that the funds total more than y 3 trillion in size .
japan has experienced two previous cases of money management funds falling under their face value , but the losses were smaller in scale .
the four fund companies are being besieged with redemptions by nervous investors anxious to retrieve their money . nikko asset management , for example , has reportedly received requests for redemptions totaling more than yl trillion out of a total fund balance of y 2 . 7 trillion .
japan investment trust management co . and sumisei global investment trust management co . , two of the other firms hit by losses on enron bonds , also received redemption requests equivalent to nearly 30 % of total fund assets . the fourth firm affected was ufj partners asset management co .
jittery investors , meanwhile , are asking other fund companies , even those not affected by the enron crisis , to disclose their asset holdings in money management funds .
in response , shinko investment trust management co . has drawn up plans to send to brokers materials disclosing all holdings in its money management fund and a medium - term government bond investment fund .
daiwa asset management co . is also considering ways to beef up disclosure for what is the largest money management fund in the industry .
analysts and industry executives are expressing concern that the declines below the par value could cause investors to rethink the safety of money management funds . these funds have been marketed as ultrasafe investment vehicles and a good alternative to bank deposits when a cap on deposit insurance protection is reimposed in april next year . with interest rates continuing to languish at extremely low levels , some fund managers have been tempted to add riskier corporate bonds to their holdings in an attempt to pump up fund yields .
money management funds had more than yl 8 trillion in assets as of the end of october , accounting for about one - third of assets in all investment trusts .

enron bonds signal anticipated enron bankruptcy filing

new york - ( dow jones ) - the corporate bond market is signaling its anticipation of an imminent bankruptcy filing by beleaguered energy services company enron corp . ( ene ) .
there is a 22 - 1 / 2 bid both for bonds maturing in 2003 and 2009 . and neither bid is with accrued interest .
the combination of the bonds trading without accrued interest , or flat , and the withering of the normal gap in price between shorter - and longer - dated maturities means the market believes " the company is probably going into bankruptcy , " said tom haag , senior analyst in charge of distressed securities , lutheran brotherhood , minneapolis .
by trading flat , investors are saying that they do not expect to receive any further interest payments from enron . and the sameness of price , regardless of maturity , signals that the market believes all the bonds will be treated the same in a bankruptcy proceeding , said haag .
normally , bond prices reflect greater risk of repayment for longer - dated maturities .
on wednesday , before standard & poor ' s and the two other major ratings agencies downgraded enron to speculative grade from investment grade , enron ' s 7 - 7 / 8 % coupon bonds maturing in 2003 were being offered at a price of $ 59 with accrued interest , traders said .
after the downgrades , prices fell into the 20 s but the bonds were still quoted with accrued interest , said harold rivkin , principal , h . rivkin 201 - 938 - 2008 ; michael . barr @ dowjones . com

steve malcolm says expected net exposure linked to enron to be less than
$ 100 million
tulsa , okla . , nov . 29 / prnewswire / - - steven j . malcolm , president and chief operating officer of williams ( nyse : wmb ) , said today he expects the company to meet or exceed all of its previously announced earnings targets .
" we are traditionally conservative in managing our risk , so we currently believe our net exposure related to enron will be less than $ 100 million , " malcolm said . " our expected earnings growth further validates our strategy of a balanced approach - - investing in strategic energy assets while deploying a marketing company that is focused on offering customers risk management products , versus relying on pure trading activities .
" we believe we are capable of growing our profitability in the years to come and remain enthusiastic about our business mix . we relish the opportunity to clearly establish our solid position to ultimately continue our demonstrated ability to deliver superior results to our shareholders , " he said .
malcolm said he believes the company will deliver recurring 2001 earnings per share of $ 2 . 40 and has the capacity to deliver an ongoing recurring earnings growth rate estimate of 15 percent or more per year .
