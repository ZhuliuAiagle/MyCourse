hi louise
have spoken with brad several times . moving to the us involves finding john a role in the us which would take some time .
i am open to moving to the us . will continue to keep communications open with brad . obviously , if you had a role within your organisation then it would be v . cool .
unfortunately , i need to choose something asap due to the broadband business contracting ( ! ) and the voluntary redundancy programme .
for now - looks like taking the spartacus role is the short term solution . will be speaking to richard later today to say yes .
let me know what you think ? ! ?
regards
amita
