could you please provide responses to the following :
- would it be ok if we use the logo for enron , the global company ?
- what will you need from us before printing ? if you need to review the
book jacket or the manuscript , please let us know .
- if enron needs to review anything , how long will it take for enron to
turn it around ?
- we are putting together a leaflet advertising our energy course . we
would like to mention the forthcoming book and that it is being sponsored
by enron . . . is this ok with you ? no logo will be used .
- we would like to produce a leaflet / brochure advertising the book as
well , but this will follow after we have the book cover designed . should i
work with andrew at stokes account ex . on this ?
- how do we handle the money side of things ?
the manuscript is not fully completed , but we may begin typesetting any day
now . i think it will take about 3 - 4 weeks to typeset and then another 3
weeks to print and bind . sometime in late april ?
it looks like we will be in houston around the 7 th of march . . . will you be
around either the 7 th or 8 th ?
i hope you are enjoying your time at home .
