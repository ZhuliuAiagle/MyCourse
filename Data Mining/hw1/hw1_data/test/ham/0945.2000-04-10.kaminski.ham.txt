dear dr . takriti ,
my name is jorge valenzuela . we met last year in the workshop , " the new
generation of unit commitment models " . after your presentation , we had a
brief conversation . i defended my ph . d . dissertation in industrial
engineering at the university of pittsburgh last december . currently , i am
teaching at the business school of the university of pittsburgh , but my
interest is to work for an electric power company such as enron .
during the last three years , my work has revolved around modeling of
electric power systems . my ph . d . dissertation deals with the scheduling of
generating units under the new operating environment . i have proposed a
formulation that includes the option of trading at market - clearing prices
with a power pool . i model the market - clearing price by a stochastic
process based on the stochastic processes of the generating unit
availabilities and the aggregate load . i use probabilistic dynamic
programming to obtain the schedule that maximizes the expected profit .
in my resume , herewith attached , i have listed some other work that i have
done in modeling electric power systems . i would like to add that i am a
very versatile person with strong background in operations research ,
statistics , and information technology .
please call or e - mail me if you think that your company could make use of
a person as me . thank you very much for your kind consideration .
best regards ,
jorge valenzuela
