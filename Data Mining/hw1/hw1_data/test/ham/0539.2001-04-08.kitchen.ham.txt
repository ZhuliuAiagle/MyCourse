Subject: re : please give sean long a ring
since you are reading e - mails , i thought i would let you know how things went with ozzie . i met with him on saturday and made the proposal we discussed . he said he was interested and wanted to follow up with a conversation on resources and compensation . i would suggest flexibility on compensation and also help in getting additional resources . i would like , however for ozzie to recognize that he would be part of the team . this is critical to integrating and optimizing the market / opportunistic approach of the regions with the product approach of generation investments . i believe that the synergies ( terrible word i ' m sorry ) here could be substantial . if he wants to be autonomous i don ' t need him . he said he was meeting with you tomorrow . i ' ll call you on monday .
