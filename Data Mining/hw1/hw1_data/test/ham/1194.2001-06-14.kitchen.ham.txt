bloody good effort - i thought you ' d have lost a lot of systems .
so how are things - thanks for the message only got it last night as the phones have been down most of the week - end . we spent the week - end figuring out alternative ways home for marcus ' s mum ( indianappolis - new york - london is how she finally got home - obviously her luggage got lost ) and also picking up my parents who are now out golfing every hour god sends as no - one else thinks the courses are open . no other damage though .
what ' s my news - nothing exciting - lavo did ring last week to tell me that everyone is saying i am going back to london , david port rang friday and said there were many rumours around ( some not so nice too ! ) . but suffice to say i presume they are all bollocks as no - one has mentioned anything to me ! but then maybe i ' ll be the last person to get consulted . matthew scrimshaw made the move to ebs so i do have some info there - but i figure you ' ll already know it as its now 4 days old ! i have never been more up to speed with emails - i only have 5 in my inbox
in other news - scott is finally sleeping more ( i got a whole 7 hours last night ) so i am back at work on monday - are you free any time this week for lunch to catch me up on the gossip before i get back ? i could never be a stay at home mum - i am lacking in all the requried attributes - patience and inability to spend money , with nothing to do apart from look after scott - i have become the demon internet spotter .
let me know about lunch
regards

other building damage was limited to flooding in the tunnels , and water damage / flooding to portions of the body shop on lv b - 1
enron center south ( 1500 louisiana )
impact / damage summary
> levels 8 & 9 received very limited amounts of water from the core area elevator shafts and exterior curtainwall . there was no exposure to water on any systems or network cabling during the entire period . ( response ) crews contained and cleaned all water as it traced into the building .
> all idf closets on lvs 3 - 5 traders floors remained dry throughout the duration of the rains / flooding on friday & saturday
> lv 6 received some water from lv 7 . ( response ) the area was contained and cleaned . no additional damage beyond tuesday evenings flooding occurred
> due to extreme street flooding and water pressure , a 10 " sanitary sewer line tied into ecs burst on friday evening causing extensive flooding of lv b - 1 area ( approximately 4 - 6 inches of water in the basement . ( response ) clark & way engr was able to install a temporary plug in the line to stop the on going flood waters from penetrating the basement . clean up has continued throughout the weekend
> due to the extreme flooding and water pressure , the water seal of the reliant vault burst early saturday and flooded the electrical vault room with 24 - 30 " of water . this resulted in a complete loss of power at approximately 1 : 30 pm on staurday afternoon . the back up systems engaged and operated per design to support the data ctr and traders floors . the temporary cooling tower went off line . prior to the flooding clark had been in the process of tieing in the temporary feed into the back up system by 7 - 1 - 01 in prep for the migration ( response )
* clark used back up water pumps to pump out and clean the reliant electrical vault , as well as maintained operation of the back up systems
* the data ctr ahu ' s were kept on line with the dehumidifiers / blowers to modulate the airflow in the data ctr . epsc had way engr techs use temp / humidity probes
to monitor the areas . the recordings indicated temps on lvs 8 the engineers and mep subs shall be conducting a thorough system review and repirs as required of all systems throughout the building during the coming
week .
in summary , the back up systems in both facilities did engage and operate as designed ; however , due to the extreme conditons and stress placed upon the systems the facility held up extremely well . i would also like to note throughout the ordeal beginning friday evening through sunday , everyone ( enron networks ; ees facilitiesclark const ; way engring ; fisk electric ; henderson electric ; kw - pillar ; hines ) did an outstanding job under enourmous pressure and the most severe conditions i have seen in downtown houston . communication , around the clock work and cool heads managed to assess damage and develop action / restoration plans to facilitate repairs for monday business
let me know if you need further details on specific issues or items .
