Subject: offsite
john and louise ,
i wanted to let you know how much i enjoyed the beaver creek offsite and to thank you for the invitation . i think everyone was impressed with how well this trip was organized - it was first class all the way . the recreational and social activities were fun , the meetings were informative , and the relationships that were formed and strengthened with other business unit leaders should prove invaluable .
thanks again !
