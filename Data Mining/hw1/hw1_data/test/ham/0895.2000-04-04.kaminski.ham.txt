just a quick email to start some discussion about the panel session you are
involved in during risk 2000 in boston on 13
similarly it is often interesting to hear the panel ' s comments on one
individual ' s more specific area of knowledge .
?
conseqently if you could return this email ( to all panel members ) with
topics you feel should be covered , any particular areas you would personally
like to focus on , any proposed changes to the actual panel structure , and
possibly additonal panel members you think should be there , that would be a
good start . i am still in the process of looking for a moderator and if
anyone has any suggestions , please let me know .
