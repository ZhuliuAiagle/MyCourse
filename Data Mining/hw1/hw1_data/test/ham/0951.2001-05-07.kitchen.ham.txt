sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today
the bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the california assembly . the republicans are currently in caucus until 3 : 30 pst and then will go to the floor for a vote . the current situation is very fluid , but sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote , lacking the two - thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance . if this is the case , the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans . absent of last minute financial rescues by davis or a new longer bridge loan package ( unlikely ) socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy . the main problem would then be the waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission line purchase or other assistance .
there is an outside chance that republican defectors could precipitate from the current caucus . there is extreme pressure on the republicans from davis and angelides . if the bill failed due to lack of republican support , it would provide davis the opportunity to blame republicans for on - going expenditures of $ 70 m / day ( power purchases ) , and a possible bankruptcy by socal . the last republican who gave support to a democratic bill ( ab lx ) , representative bill campbell , lost his job . sources also confirm that democrats have not met with republicans on the bond issuance since last week .
