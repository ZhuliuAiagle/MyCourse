subject : deferred compensation scheme for uk nationals
mary ,
pwc has introduced a deferred compensation scheme to louise kitchen that would allow uk foreign nationals to defer income tax free under certain circumstances . they will be sending over details on monday . the idea would involve the existing enron deferred compensation plans . let us know who we should work with on your team . we will be moving quickly on this .
regards ,
