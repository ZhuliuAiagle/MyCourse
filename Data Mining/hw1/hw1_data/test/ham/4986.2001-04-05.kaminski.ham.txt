chris ,
e hired tony to support global markets but jeff shankman decided that , given
highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
research group , with a dotted line to mike roberts who is running our weather
group .
given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit gm , it makes sense
for research to charge his expenses
to global markets . we can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to
different sub - units of gm .
tony spent the last few weeks in houston training for his position in london
with mike roberts .
we are very excited about the prospect of working with him .

tony was hired to work for global markets . think costs should be assigned
to vince or mark but if you
believe those costs should be for my group let me know .
