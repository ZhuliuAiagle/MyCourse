what i ' m proposing is that when someone visiting the enrononline site clicks on a link to a market page ( i . e . , us natural gas ) , a new browser window will open taking them to www . enron . com / wholesale / ( whatevercommodity ) . the enrononline page from which they came will also remain open .
the markets pages migrated to enron . com will include a prominent link back to the enrononline homepage ( we ' ll work with b . rigney here ) , but jay feels we should not allow a login to enrononline from the enron . com pages as that may send users ' scary ' security alerts , depending on the security settings of their browsers .
regards ,
erica
