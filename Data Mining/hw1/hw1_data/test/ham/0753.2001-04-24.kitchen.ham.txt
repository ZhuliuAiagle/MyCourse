Subject: fw : epc negotiation team
louise ,
i have revised the memo to reflect comments from mark h . and joe d . . going forward we will have a rac representative on the team , however , the specific rac person will change based on the deal . i suggest that we need to get this team " officially working " in order to get a lot of the turbopark static out of the system . we need to make turbopark work for the projects and make the projects work for turbopark . getting everyone on the same side of the table will help .
regards ,
brian

brian ,
the memo as written is fine .
i do have a general concern about the need for a rigid and corporate based qualification process for contractors . maybe this is influenced by just visiting dabhol and seeing first hand the problems we have created by using marginally qualified contractors , but to me it would make sense to have a corporate based team including rac for this function . financial positions of engineering and construction contractors are difficult to understand . it is a business that does not neatly fit a yearly reporting concept and requires significant experience to evaluate . i doubt your epc team will have the time to adequately perform this function . a small team continuously working as a committee on the evaluation of contractors could prevent a lot of tears . i believe strongly in looking at new contractors especially private ones with strong leadership , but we need to clearly identify the risk . in addition the entire e & c industry is at risk due to thin margins and / or risk .
