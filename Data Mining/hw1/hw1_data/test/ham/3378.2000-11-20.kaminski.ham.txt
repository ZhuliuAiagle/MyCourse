Subject: personal time on tuesday , nov . 21 , 2000
shirley :
just a reminder that i had requested time - off on tuesday , november 21 , 2000 ,
to attend a school function that i attend every year for a little friend of
ours . i know you will be on vacation but leann will be here to help vince
or any of the rest of the department . i would not normally take off when you
are gone , but this is really important to riley and i hate to disappoint
him . his school has grandparents day the tuesday before thanksgiving every
year . he does not have grandparents that can attend so he has always asked
my husband and i to come as his special friends . usually , al could just go
alone but as you know he is in hawaii taking care of his father and will not
be here tomorrow . i have worked enough extra hours to cover the time i will
be off ( 9 : 00 am to 1 : 00 pm or 1 : 30 pm ) . i appreciate your consideration and
thanks in advance if we can work this out .
