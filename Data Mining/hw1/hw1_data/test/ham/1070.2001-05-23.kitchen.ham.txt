republican plan b
a source reports the following regarding the republican plan b proposal :
? encourage direct access for consumers . ( the problem with this , however , is that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component , and too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the bonds . )
? the republicans will " suggest " that generators take a 30 % haircut . " we think this is doable . "
? the republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets .
? restore the invetor - owned utility model for generation . they would establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation by the utilities . they would grant ratepayers equity interest in these plants .
? resolve the qfs ' financial issues .
assemblyman cox commented afterward that the republcans have been trying to work on a bilateral basis with the democrats on these issues , but they feel " frozen out . " moreover , he senses the democrats moving back toward having an option to purchase socal ' s transmission assets , which the republicans oppose .

? sources indicate that the democrats are developing a post - petition plan in cast socal files for bankruptcy , including the following :
- the state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy . it then would sell of pieces of the utilities to various private - sector buyers , but with a lifetime stipulation on how they will be run .
