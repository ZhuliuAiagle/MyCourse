vince & stinson ,
i was given your names by lynn dunphy in recruiting and am taking the liberty
of forwarding you the attached cv . steve roeder is a former collegiate
swimmer and currently coach of the master ' s swimming program in the woodlands
( my wife is president of the program ) . he is also currently employed at air
liquide usa ( or one of its subsidiaries ) over in the galleria area . as a
consequence of air liquide ' s pending merger with boc , steve believes that
there will be significant personnel reductions sometime during 2000 and is
taking action now to try to locate his next professional challenge .
lynn suggested there might be a fit with your group and i would be grateful
if you could have a look and let me know whether you might be interested .
alternatively , if you don ' t see a fit ( or are adequately staffed at the
moment ) , i would be grateful for any suggestions you might have as to whom i
might contact internally on steve ' s behalf .
many thanks in advance .

mike -
thanks for taking the time to talk last evening . ? i really appreciated it . ?
( by the way , how is life in the white house now that you are living with a
president ? ? is air force one all that it is cracked up to be ? )
please see the attached document . ? by reading between the lines , hopefully
one can see that , whereas my training has been highly technical , my desire to
transform my career into the business side of a high - technology application
is set in this good foundation ( rather than limited by it ) .
thanks again for your support .
