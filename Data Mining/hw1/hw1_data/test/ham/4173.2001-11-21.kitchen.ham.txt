Subject: cad 9 mm
received this afternoon by cibc ( our bank ) at about 2 : 50 pm . we just got
notification a few minutes ago . we are still unsure as too why the delay .
fyi , value date for wires was for today , even though you sent wires out on
20 th ? robin ( enron cash management ) and your calgary traders have been
informed .
thanks
