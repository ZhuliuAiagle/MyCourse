louise ,
thank you for your suggestion . i agree that it is critical for us to get feedbacks from geof as early as possible . for instance , geof suggested some changes to the design last friday . the suggestion requires some re - work on the user interface and some changes in the daily risk management process .
i love to have the team meet geof daily . i will check with geof for his availability .
thanks

i think we need to get a lot closer together - i expect geoff ( and the analyst working for geoff on this ) to be spending a lot more time down on the it floors . if we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any divergence from how geoff sees the end result to what actually appears .
could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with geoff - i would suggest you have a daily time when you all ( developers included ) sit down around a desk to look at progress .
let me know what you think ?
louise
