dynegy and enron shares get a boost as acquisition plan is met with optimism

the shares of enron corp . and dynegy inc . both rose in heavy trading as investors began trying to digest the possible risks and rewards of dynegy ' s plan to acquire enron in a stock swap with a current value of $ 10 . 12 billion .
in calls and meetings with analysts yesterday , dynegy chairman chuck watson and enron chairman kenneth lay continued talking up the deal that was announced late friday . " we are confident this is good strategically and financially for dynegy and enron , " said mr . watson , who will serve as chairman and chief executive of the combined entity , to be called dynegy inc .
while the proposed combination faces months of review by government agencies and gives dynegy possible opportunities to cancel the deal , investors ' initial reaction to the merger announcement was positive . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , dynegy shares were at $ 44 . 31 , up $ 5 . 55 , or 14 % . also on the big board , enron was at $ 9 . 24 , up 7 . 1 % , or 61 cents . both companies were among the most actively traded issues .
under terms of the proposed acquisition , dynegy would give 0 . 2685 of its shares for each enron share . based on dynegy ' s stock price yesterday , this formula values enron stock at $ 11 . 90 each . enron has about 850 million shares outstanding .
some people raised cautionary notes yesterday . moody ' s investors service placed dynegy on review for a possible credit - ratings downgrade . standard & poor ' s made a similar move on friday . moody ' s said that while it saw positive elements to the proposed combination , it also believed " the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact dynegy ' s credit fundamentals . "
prudential securities analyst carol coale , who counts herself a fan of dynegy , also worries that enron ' s enormous problems could be a drag on the combined entity . " i don ' t want the dynegy folks to get into something that ' s not good for the company , " she said .
as reported , enron in the past several weeks has seen its stock price and standing in the investment community plummet , largely as the result of large - scale transactions it did with partnerships headed by enron officers . those transactions have produced hundreds of millions of dollars of write - offs and restatements in the past month . they are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission and have helped spawn more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits .

gas pipeline is prominent as dynegy seeks enron

c . 2001 new york times company
dynegy has negotiated a great takeover . and it may end up buying enron , too .
as part of its planned acquisition of enron , dynegy will get the crown jewel even if the overall deal falls apart . in return for its $ 1 . 5 billion investment today , dynegy has the right to acquire northern natural gas , a pipeline system that is probably worth more .
as dynegy stock soared 14 percent yesterday , enron ' s lagged behind , rising just 7 percent . [ page cl 3 . ]
that widened the spread - - the profit a trader could lock in by buying enron and selling dynegy short , assuming the deal goes through - - to 28 percent .
the big premium probably reflects more than the fact that this deal will not close for many months . it is at least a possibility that dynegy will renegotiate the price , or even walk away , as it learns more about enron ' s business .
not that chuck watson , chairman and chief executive of dynegy , was threatening to do any such thing . in a talk to analysts yesterday , and in a later interview , he was extraordinarily upbeat about enron ' s trading business even as he dismissed many of the company ' s diversifications as failures whose poor performance might have been obscured by fancy accounting .
full details of the agreement between the companies will not be known until the merger agreement is filed with the securities and exchange commission today or tomorrow . but it appears that if the agreement falls apart for any reason , dynegy has the right to keep the pipeline without putting up any additional cash .
speaking to analysts yesterday , rob doty , chief financial officer at dynegy , said the company was paying about seven or eight times the cash flow of the pipeline business .
walking away from the deal might cost dynegy $ 350 million if it could not cite any material adverse change in enron ' s business , as provided in the merger agreement . but one way to look at this deal is that dynegy is spending $ 1 . 85 billion for the pipeline and a right to get the rest of enron on the agreed terms .
mr . watson said he was confident that things would not go wrong .
' ' we have comfort there is not another shoe to drop , ' ' he said . ' ' if there is no shoe , this is a phenomenally good transaction . ' '
in presentations to analysts , dynegy officials said they expected the company ' s earnings per share to grow by at least 90 cents a year even before considering cost reductions as the two businesses are merged . that arithmetic was based on assumptions that enron could deliver at least 75 percent of the $ 2 a share in pro - forma earnings that wall street had been forecasting for next year . those forecasts had stayed the same even as enron ' s business collapsed .
the bullish case for the merger is that enron ' s real profits were there and that the financial maneuvering did not cover up far deeper problems .
mr . watson promised that more details would be disclosed about the partnerships that were created by enron and traded with it , providing a substantial part of the company ' s profits in 2000 .
enron ' s need to make a deal quickly - - almost any deal - - was emphasized by standard & poor ' s , the bond rating service . in a conference call yesterday , ron barone , an analyst with s . & p . , said that without the takeover , enron ' s rating would have been cut to low bb or high b . those ratings are not even at the high end of junk , and a company like enron , which depends on others being willing to treat it as a trusted trading partner , needs an investment grade rating . its current s . & p . rating is bbb minus , the lowest investment grade rating .
that means enron could not continue as an independent business . and it means that should dynegy decide to renegotiate , enron would be in a very poor bargaining position unless it had another bidder .

suitor for enron receives approval from wall st .

wall street found nothing but good news in dynegy ' s $ 9 billion takeover of the enron corporation yesterday .
three days after dynegy , an energy marketing and trading company based in houston , agreed to take over enron , its giant crosstown rival , dynegy executives came to new york to assure investors that the deal would sharply increase their company ' s profits . they met a receptive audience .
dynegy stock closed yesterday at $ 44 . 31 , up $ 5 . 55 , or 14 . 3 percent . since last wednesday , when news of a possible takeover emerged , dynegy ' s stock has risen more than one - third . enron closed at $ 9 . 24 , up 61 cents , or 7 . 1 percent .
after some initial uncertainty about the takeover , investors appear to have accepted dynegy ' s view that the deal will give it a lucrative franchise in trading natural gas and electricity . enron ' s stock fell almost 80 percent in the weeks leading up to the deal as enron said it had overstated its earnings by almost $ 600 million since 1997 and forced out several top executives .
but chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman , told investors repeatedly yesterday that enron ' s problems were mainly a result of failed expansion efforts . he largely dismissed the concerns of some short - sellers and analysts that enron might be hiding losses at its core energy trading operations .
' ' there ' s nothing wrong with enron ' s business , ' ' mr . watson said in an interview at the waldorf - astoria hotel after making a lunchtime presentation to analysts and investors . ' ' the people in it ought to be really upset that for the last several years , they have produced earnings and cash that have been invested in other businesses that are not making money . ' '
enron ' s immediate problem was a crisis of confidence , which could have caused other companies to stop trading with it , mr . watson said . a $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from dynegy should restore the confidence of enron ' s business partners and keep enron stable until the takeover is complete , he said . to bolster enron further , j . p . morgan chase and citigroup may each invest an additional $ 250 million , executives close to the deal said . the potential investments by j . p . morgan chase and citigroup were reported yesterday in the wall street journal .
mr . watson said dynegy would also move quickly to assuage enron employees who are angry that kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman , and other top executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in 2000 and this year as enron ' s shares plunged . ' ' right now , there ' s some animosity over there , ' ' he said .
many employees at enron will get new grants of stock options when the acquisition is completed , he said . the company said it expected the deal to close by the end of the third quarter of next year , after extensive reviews from federal and state energy regulators and the department of justice .
mr . watson predicted that the deal would lift dynegy ' s earnings by 90 cents or more a share next year , to more than $ 3 . 45 a share .
analysts backed that view yesterday . ' ' investments in noncore business distracted the attention of management and also took up capital , ' ' said thomas hamlin , an analyst at wachovia securities . mr . hamlin said he believed that dynegy had obtained enron , which reported more than $ 100 billion in revenue last year , for a bargain price .
' ' it ' s not too often you get to take out the no . 7 fortune 500 company and double your earnings in the meantime , ' ' he said . ' ' my guess is the stock is worth $ 70 per share . ' '
the deal could increase dynegy ' s earnings by $ 1 to $ 2 a share next year , said christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at the williams capital group .
' ' that ' s a whopper , ' ' he said . ' ' it ' s a very good deal financially , certainly should be a good deal strategically , and provides some immediate balance - sheet backstop for enron . ' '
mr . lay said in an interview that enron had been forced to sell itself because of ' ' the relentlessness of all the articles and the shorts . ' '
' ' we realized that we needed to do something to stabilize the ship , ' ' he said . ' ' a good company was being badly tarnished . ' '

share boost for dynegy good news
saving enron trading called key handicap
by laura goldberg and david ivanovich
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
although investors monday cheered dynegy ' s planned acquisition of enron corp . , dynegy must still negotiate a series of potential roadblocks to pull off a successful merger .
among them : ensuring that enron ' s core energy - trading business , suffering before the merger announcement , stays healthy . negative news on that front quickly surfaced monday as at least two traders said they still plan extremely limited business with enron .
dynegy must also manage any unexpected disclosures about enron ' s financial performance and investment partnerships , convince enron ' s traders and other key employees to stick around , and mesh different corporate cultures .
investors were optimistic in dynegy ' s abilities as shares in the company traded up $ 5 . 55 to close at $ 44 . 31 monday , while shares in enron ended the day up 61 cents at $ 9 . 24 .
enron has been under siege since oct . 16 when it reported a $ 35 million loss and $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity tied to business dealings with investment partnerships run by its then - chief financial officer .
since then , the securities and exchange commission started an investigation of enron , a slew of shareholder lawsuits were filed and enron ' s stock price plummeted .
a new shareholder suit filed monday included dynegy on its list of defendants .
last week , enron said it was restating its earnings back to 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships , including several being investigated by the sec . it said it was correcting almost $ 600 million worth of mistakes .
just how close enron was to a collapse remains unclear . one industry source believes enron had been pushed " to the brink " and would have been done for if it had been unable to reach agreement with dynegy last week .
but ron barone , a credit analyst with standard & poor ' s , doesn ' t think enron ' s condition was so desperate .
" we clearly didn ' t see this as an imminent bankruptcy or imminent default , but it is something that could have eroded over time . . . in a fairly short time . "
friday , enron ' s long - term debt rating was downgraded to one notch above investment - grade status by both moody ' s investors service and s & p .
enron is the largest natural gas and electricity trader in the nation , accounting for about 25 percent of all transactions . its collapse would have meant the loss of much liquidity in the trading market , making trades more difficult and prices more volatile , industry experts said .
dynegy announced a deal friday to buy enron at a fire - sale price of almost $ 9 billion in stock , plus the assumption of about $ 13 billion in debt and $ 2 billion in preferred stock . the merger is expected to close , barring holdups from regulators , in six to nine months .
as part of the agreement , dynegy stakeholder chevrontexaco is giving dynegy $ 1 . 5 billion , which is to be infused today to help shore up enron ' s liquidity and preserve its trading franchise .
some of enron ' s former trading partners are still steering clear of the giant .
to facilitate transactions , the various energy trading firms extend credit to one another . those agreements are contingent upon a partner maintaining an adequate rating .
if the credit rating firms had downgraded enron ' s debt to junk status , its trading operation would have been devastated , industry officials said .
as details of enron ' s questionable financial dealings have been revealed , enron ' s trading partners have been scrambling to reduce their exposure .
kansas city , mo . - based aquila energy marketing corp . , for instance , has been ratcheting down its activity with enron , company spokesman al butkus said .
by the end of last week , aquila ' s exposure to enron was " insignificant , " butkus said . " and after all that was revealed on friday and the downgrading of the credit , we are now at an even lower level . "
atlanta - based mirant has likewise reduced its exposure and is only doing a limited amount of business with enron .
some larger players , however , continue doing deals with the company .
" reliant energy has consistently been trading with enron through its difficulties , albeit with a heightened sense of caution , " said shahid malik , president of houston - based reliant energy ' s trading operation .
charlotte , n . c . - based duke energy ' s exposure stands at $ 100 million .
" we ' re continuing the way we have been , " said duke spokesman terry francisco .
john olson , an analyst with sanders morris harris in houston , predicted it would take the traders some time to digest the merger deal .
" i think people will increasingly come back to enron just as soon as the $ 1 . 5 billion changes hands , " he said .
traders still have incentives to do business with enron even though it ' s being sold , as it has a wider variety of products than some of its competitors and its enrononline internet trading operation is regarded as superior .
on a conference call with investors and analysts monday morning , dynegy and enron executives fielded a variety of questions about the merger but refused comment on a wall street journal report that j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup are considering a $ 500 million investment in enron .
analysts remain worried that new and troubling surprises will emerge about enron ' s finances , including those that could call into question whether its core trading business is as advertised .
dynegy executives aren ' t expecting any such disclosures , but took a conservative approach to calculating merger benefits .
" i believe we have adequately bracketed the downside , " said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive .
even with a worst - case scenario , dynegy still found a " tremendous amount of economic value " in the merger , said watson , who will take the same roles after the merger .
the deal , dynegy said , will add 90 cents to 95 cents per share in earnings for current dynegy shareholders . and that ' s before cost savings that are expected to run $ 400 million to $ 500 million a year .
dynegy detailed two escape clauses in the merger deal . for one , if the amount of legal and shareholder claims enron must pay out is greater than $ 3 . 5 billion , it can be called off .
enron and dynegy officials also said they will do whatever it takes to keep their key people . but will traders jump ship ? " oh , yeah i ' m sure they will , " the industry source said .

dynegy , enron stock prices get boost energy : even as experts warn of regulatory hurdles , investors back proposed merger .

investors and analysts applauded the proposed $ 9 - billion merger of dynegy inc . and enron corp . , boosting the stock price of both houston - based energy companies on monday even as some experts warned of regulatory hurdles .
dynegy and enron executives courted wall street by offering assurances that the combined company , to be called dynegy , would be more financially conservative and easier to understand than enron has been .
dynegy chief executive charles l . watson said the merger would immediately sweeten earnings for the combined company and that he remains " 90 % certain " that no more nasty surprises will emerge from a continuing internal investigation of enron ' s cloudy finances .
" this is an exciting business combination . . . that will fuse two groups of talented , dedicated people who share a passion for their work , " said watson , who would be chairman and chief executive of the new company .
dynegy ' s stock leaped $ 5 . 55 to close at $ 44 . 31 on the new york stock exchange while enron ' s stock increased 61 cents to $ 9 . 24 .
the proposed transaction , revealed late friday after days of rumors , marks an extraordinary humbling of enron and its powerful chairman and ceo , kenneth l . lay . enron is the world ' s largest energy trader , but a loss of investor confidence and a severe cash crunch have pushed it into the arms of a competitor that is one - quarter its size .
under the deal , enron shareholders would get 0 . 2685 dynegy share for each share of enron stock . based on the $ 38 . 76 close friday of dynegy ' s stock on the new york stock exchange , the deal valued enron ' s stock at $ 10 . 40 a share - - or $ 11 . 89 a share based on monday ' s close . dynegy would convert 850 million enron shares , the company said .
dynegy said monday that its deal is worth about $ 24 billion in all : the $ 9 - billion stock swap and the assumption of $ 2 billion of preferred stock and $ 13 billion in debt . enron would get an immediate cash infusion from chevrontexaco corp . , which owns nearly 27 % of dynegy , with an additional $ 1 billion to follow when the deal closes .
enron ' s stock fell 80 % after a series of disturbing financial disclosures that began oct . 16 with a surprise third - quarter loss tied to failed investments in water and telecommunications and losses from the termination of some off - balance - sheet partnerships .
enron also revealed that $ 1 . 2 billion had been shaved off shareholders ' equity because of those partnerships . the securities and exchange commission launched an investigation into the investment vehicles , and the company fired three executives linked to the partnerships .
an internal investigation led enron to admit it overstated profit by $ 586 million , or 20 % , going back to 1997 .
all those disclosures are unrelated to enron ' s core businesses of energy trading , energy marketing and natural gas pipelines , said dynegy president steve bergstrom , and it is those businesses that dynegy wants .
" we have had the opportunity to look under the hood of their core businesses and have found no surprises , " said bergstrom , who would be president of the combined company . dynegy expects those businesses alone to add as much as 95 cents a share to the combined company ' s earnings the first year , and dynegy has built protections into the deal if more surprises emerge from noncore businesses or off - balance - sheet partnerships , the executives said .
among the protections : dynegy or enron would receive $ 350 million if the other backs out of the deal ; dynegy can abandon the transaction if lawsuit and financial liabilities exceed $ 3 . 5 billion ; and if the deal falls apart , dynegy gets enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline .
the combined company would be leader in all of its primary businesses , watson said , with revenue of more than $ 200 billion and assets of more than $ 90 billion . the new dynegy would be the world ' s largest energy trader and would own 25 , 000 miles of natural gas pipelines and 22 , 500 megawatts of electricity generation .
it is that powerhouse role that may give regulators pause , energy and antitrust experts say .
california atty . gen . bill lockyer has not taken a position on the proposed merger . dynegy co - owns three power plants in california and enron controls a portion of the state ' s natural gas supply through its pipeline and trading businesses .

enron shares enriched ken lay before flaming out : graef crystal
2001 - 11 - 13 01 : 01 ( new york )
( commentary . graef crystal is a columnist for bloomberg
news . the opinions expressed are his own . )
las vegas , nov . 13 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . shareholders
never blinked as chief executive officer kenneth lay piled up pay
- - salary , bonuses , stock grants and options - - that would meet
almost any definition of excessive .
from 1993 to the end of 2000 , lay ' s potential compensation
came to $ 614 million if you add unexercised option profits to the
millions he actually pocketed .
sad to say , lay ' s paper profit of $ 362 million at the end of
2000 has evaporated as enron ' s stock lost about 90 percent of its
value . the houston , texas , energy company , beset by accounting
problems , is now being bought by a smaller competitor , dynegy
inc .
still , the 59 - year - old lay hauled away $ 31 . 5 million a year
in real dollars over the last eight years , a generous amount
given enron ' s recent admission - - after the securities and
exchange commission opened an investigation - - that it overstated
earnings by $ 586 million in five of those years .
lay was enron ' s ceo from the time it was formed 15 years ago
in a merger of natural - gas pipeline operators until he stepped
down in february for prot ? g ? jeffrey skilling . skilling left
unexpectedly in august for ` ` personal ' ' reasons .
ceo ' s return
in six months under skilling , enron ' s total return to
shareholders was a negative 46 percent , four times worse than the
performance of the standard & poor ' s 500 index . it was also a
sharp contrast to the 30 percent a year enron returned to
shareholders over the previous eight years under lay , when the
company ' s performance was almost double that of the s & p 500 .
so lay became ceo again after skilling ' s mid - august
departure - - and enron ' s performance has now been even worse :
minus 78 percent versus the 5 . 8 percent negative return of for
the s & p 500 .
while lay has an employment agreement extending all the way
to 2005 , the company ' s pending acquisition by dynegy leaves his
future in doubt . for enron ' s battered shareholders , whose stock
once was among the s & p 500 ' s top performers , that may not be such
bad news .
enron shareholders endured a roller - coaster ride during
lay ' s long tenure , their stock 2 . 2 times as volatile as that of
the s & p 500 index .
lay , and some other enron executives , were responsible for
at least some of the heavy activity in their company ' s shares .
lay exercised and sold option shares twice a day on every trading
day this year through aug . 21 , on last report . in the process , he
dumped about 300 , 000 option shares to reap about $ 26 million .
royal treatment
that comes atop his realized option gains of $ 123 million in
2000 and another $ 44 million the year before that .
shedding large numbers of option shares might seem
reasonable for a ceo about to leave the company . for someone
continuing as board chairman , such behavior raises suspicion he
might have known before others what a bad investment enron was
about to become .
over the past eight years , lay has received bonuses totaling
$ 19 . 8 million , free shares worth $ 12 . 7 million at the time of
their grant , payouts under miscellaneous stock - option plans of
$ 3 . 5 million and a whopping 11 million option shares .
those figures don ' t include free personal travel on company
planes . in 2000 alone , that little item came to $ 334 , 000 .
if lay has been handsomely compensated , he has treated his
outside directors royally . enron ' s current proxy statement
informs shareholders that directors in 2000 received an average
of $ 79 , 107 in cash , deferred compensation , phantom stock units
and stock options granted in lieu of cash .
who knew ?
by itself , that figure might not seem egregious . parsing the
artful language of the proxy , one reads further to find that each
outside director also received a stock option covering 10 , 775
shares at a strike price of $ 75 . 13 a share . i estimate the
present value of that option to be $ 315 , 000 , making for a
director ' s total pay of an eye - popping $ 394 , 000 .
to be sure , those options are now way underwater , given
enron ' s closing price yesterday of $ 9 . 24 . still , the fact they
were granted at all suggests that enron ' s directors must have had
a warm fuzzy feeling for lay while treating him so munificently .
politically , too , lay has shown generosity and a deft touch :
he gave $ 2 , 000 directly to president george w . bush ' s campaign ,
another $ 275 , 000 in soft money to the republican party and has
long been an adviser to bush on energy matters .
even if he was unaware of the accounting issues that helped
bring down enron , lay still profited hugely from a stock price
that soared on the strength of inflated numbers . and , as the ceo ,
he bears ultimate responsibility for what goes on in the company
he helped found and has run for most of the past 15 years .
the question arises , to echo a phrase made famous during the
watergate era : ` ` what did ken lay know , and when did he know
it ? ' '

just as enron is showing us how a public company should not shift private equity exposure off its balance sheet , sandy schwab , son of charles schwab , and middlebury capital , a new york - based hedge fund , are providing an alternative model .
mr schwab ' s firm chess ventures is raising a private equity fund that will specialise in financial services technology , according to a source close to the fund - raising . the idea is to attract 10 to 12 banks from around the world to co - invest in technology companies specialising in financial services .
the idea is similar to the corporate venturing activities undertaken by a host of california technology companies . they jumped into venture capital in the late 1990 s , not just because there seemed to be stacks of money to be made , but also so they could become partners to thrusting future competitors , rather than victims of their cutting - edge technology .
technology is also a vital business for financial services companies - and not just for those like schwab with a heavy presence in internet trading . every year , banks and brokers plough hundreds of millions of dollars into trading , settlement and risk management systems .
but the problems with corporate venturing became clear when companies such as jp morgan chase , wells fargo , dell and intel registered significant earnings volatility as the value of their venture capital holdings was marked down significantly .
enron got around these problems by setting up an off - balance sheet vehicle with a number of additional investors . its idea was to distance its earnings statement from volatile investments in the new power company and rhythm netconnections . but eventually , those investments came home to roost .
enron had to compensate it co - investors in the structure for their losses arising from its private equity investments , and paid a heavy price for the apparent subterfuge of keeping them out of the public view .
the schwab fund seems to offer the benefits of corporate venturing without some of its costs . the investors , who it is hoped will eventually contribute $ 100 m to $ 150 m to the new fund , will share the benefits of whatever technology is developed and they will probably also be the first customers of the companies they are sponsoring .
but because they are all taking a relatively small part of the pie they should ameliorate their overall risk .
spreading the risks like this would be hard to pull off in a totally domestic structure . corporate venturing is , after all , meant to give a company an edge over its competitors .
but diversifying the fund internationally should allow the chess fund to spread the risks . the fundraisers are talking to banks in the uk and scandinavia , among other places . if the theories of growing european cross - border integration and competition come to fruition some of the bank co - investors might end up competing but in the meantime separating investors by geography seems like a safe bet .
schwab and the other investors could , of course , have put their money into other stand - alone venture funds . that would at least have solved the problem of keeping their volatile private equity exposure on balance sheet , but stand - alone funds with the sharp focus that a corporate venturing outfit has are fairly few and far between .
corporate venture capital groups , where the corporation involved is a strategic investor rather than just a speculator , are usually narrowly focused on their parent group ' s industry because they are in the business of helping their parent develop a strategic edge . a few venture firms focus very narrowly on enterprise software but often they want to keep their options to invest in , say , biotechnology , if that area suddenly looks promising .
for non - strategic investors that approach has clear advantages . technology investments have suffered over the last 18 months , while biotech investments have held up relatively well . if investors are right about the dramatic impact of information technology on biotechnology , investors in a general fund that has had the foresight to bet on those changes will probably do very well .
but the schwab approach is all about venturing as a way to extend research and development . venturing can tap into the reserves of entrepreneurship that have served the us so well in the 1990 s in a way that traditional research and development probably cannot .
entrepreneurship does , however , come at a price . young companies can and do fail . their values can swing wildly .
an off - balance sheet approach with clear strategic benefits might allow companies to have their cake and eat it .

comment & analysis - enron reaps the whirlwind .

comment and it brought a set of assets that could provide security of supply to the new dematerialised energy trading .
we will come back to what went wrong at enron later . but first notice how much went right in the newly market - oriented industries . critics argued that an integrated business , tightly controlled from the centre , was essential for security of supply . but british electricity privatisation proved you could switch to a market - oriented system quickly and smoothly - and the lights stayed on .
all you needed were proper regulations , a freely operating supply side and a bunch of active market - makers . these were not always present - for example , the absence of the first two gave california an electricity shortage . but if the markets were properly set up , everything worked like clockwork .
the new era had a simple creed . before there were effective markets , companies needed to be vertically integrated to cope with unexpected fluctuations in demand and supply . but now markets allowed them to handle that risk more efficiently , buying and selling what they needed . trading exploded : enron alone recorded revenues of over $ 100 bn ( # 68 bn ) in 2000 .
so what did go wrong ? enron expanded its markets too aggressively , moving far beyond energy through a web - based platform called enrononline . as mr skilling put it in an interview with businessweek : " we ' re on the side of angels . we ' re taking on the entrenched monopolies . we ' re bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world . "
expensively , enron rushed into trading telecoms bandwidth , building a big network to ensure it could deliver a scale of demand that never materialised .
mr skilling left abruptly in august , citing personal reasons . this autumn the company announced it had been engaging in transactions with supposedly independent entities that should , in fact , have been consolidated with its own accounts . some of these were headed - in a clear conflict of interest - by its own chief financial officer . correcting the accounting caused big restatements of earnings .
this may , of course , just be the growing pains of an innovative but overly ambitious company . in that case , enron may prosper under new ownership - it agreed to be taken over by dynegy , a much smaller rival , on friday . dynegy will slash the range of enron ' s activities to focus on energy . if the sale goes through , such an approach may restore enron to health .
but perhaps the enron problems tell us something more significant about the rush to turn formerly integrated businesses into markets .
to get these to work requires active market - makers like enron . creating liquidity in previously illiquid markets soaks up capital . nalin kulatilaka , professor of finance at boston university ' s management school , has studied enron for years . " the bottom line is that when the liquidity on the two sides of a market are very different , " he says , " a company that tries to lead the way in creating these marketplaces is going to bear sustained liquidity risks . "
the risks that the old system had coped with by building a layer of inefficiency into its operations did not go away in the new market era . enron knew all about these risks : managing them , through complex trades , was its essential skill .
james lam , founder of the consultancy erisk , says : " enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in risk management . it put in systems to manage risk on a real time basis , and had very strong management . "
but risk is a bit like a balloon . squeeze it down in one area and it bulges out in another . even if the operational risk was managed with great skill , the underlying riskiness of the strategy enron was pursuing could not be wished away . except , perhaps , by transactions that passed it on to outside entities . the problem was that those entities were not really outside at all .
despite enron ' s problems , the shift to a market - based approach is now irreversible - for energy markets at least . ed krapels , who runs energy security analysis in boston , says : " clearly enron ' s trading culture has been adopted by every one of the big oil companies except exxon . "
but , he adds , there is a big difference between companies with trading at their core , like enron and dynegy , and those that have added a trading approach to a business fundamentally based on physical assets , such as bp . the leverage and aggression in such businesses is much lower .
dynegy ' s rescue of enron was only made possible by an injection of cash from chevrontexaco , which owns 26 per cent of dynegy ' s shares . call it the revenge of the entrenched monopolies . energy markets may not be as efficient without an aggressive enron . but if they come back into the embrace of the big physical operators , they may cope a little better with the unpredictable riskiness of the real world .

andersen could face sec sanction , suits over enron accounting error

houston - - arthur andersen may face u . s . securities and exchange commission sanction and shareholder lawsuits because it certified enron corp . financial reports that the company disavowed last week as inaccurate , legal and accounting experts said .
andersen , the world ' s fifth - largest accounting firm , served as enron ' s outside auditor for more than a decade . last week , the company reported that it overstated earnings by $ 586 million over 41 / 2 years , inflated shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion because of an " accounting error , " and failed to consolidate results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet .
enron restated its financial reports as the company suffered a cash crisis triggered by disclosure of the cut in shareholder equity and the start of an sec investigation .
" i ' d be very surprised if the sec didn ' t go after arthur andersen , " said alan bromberg , securities law professor at southern methodist university .
andersen partner david tabolt has said the firm is cooperating with a special committee of enron ' s board of directors appointed to investigate the accounting problems .
lynn turner , who was the sec ' s chief accountant for three years until he resigned in august , said enron and andersen ignored a basic accounting rule when they overstated shareholder equity .
explaining the equity reduction last week , enron said it had given common stock to companies created by enron ' s former chief financial officer in exchange for notes receivable , and then improperly increased shareholder equity on its balance sheet by the value of the notes .
" what we teach in college is that you don ' t record equity until you get cash for it , and a note is not cash , " said turner , who is now director of the center for quality financial reporting at colorado state university .
" it ' s a mystery how both the company would violate , and the auditors would miss , such a basic accounting rule , when the number is $ 1 billion . "

investors upbeat about merger between dynegy and enron

houston ( ap ) - while troubled enron corp . brings a certain amount of financial baggage in its union with rival dynegy inc . , the merger will create a new company that while strong won ' t dominate the energy market , according to several analysts .
but others still expressed concerns with the deal between the two houston - based companies , citing strategic and cultural differences between the two companies and potential antitrust issues .
meanwhile , investors on monday gave a tentative thumbs up to the merger . dynegy shares rose $ 5 . 55 , or 14 percent , to close at $ 44 . 31 , while enron shares were up 61 cents , or 7 percent to $ 9 . 24 on the new york stock exchange .
enron ' s financial crises had left many fearing severe disruptions in the energy market , daniel ford , an analyst with lehman brothers wrote monday in a research note to clients .
" we believe the terms of the announced merger agreement are a path to resolving these fears , " ford wrote .
duane grubert , an analyst with sanford c . bernstein and co . , said any antitrust concerns that might arise from the deal will be minimal because the energy market will be able to absorb the new company ' s impact .
" while there is risk , the prize is so big the parties will go through it and the deal will ultimately close , " grubert said .
but carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities inc . , wrote in a research note to clients she had several concerns about the deal , including whether dynegy will be successful in retaining enron ' s " talented " energy trading and marketing personnel and whether both companies have compatible trading strategies .
dynegy officials said monday the proposed deal was " doable , " would clear all antitrust hurdles and be completed within nine months .
" what we have done is literally taken the worst case ( scenario ) and even in the worst case there is a lot of economic value for both companies , " said chuck watson , chairman and chief executive officer of dynegy , during a conference call monday .
the deal , worth at least $ 9 billion , was announced friday . dynegy will also assume $ 13 billion of enron debt . the enron name will disappear .
under the deal , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns more than a quarter of dynegy , would immediately provide about $ 1 . 5 billion . chevrontexaco would contribute an additional $ 1 billion upon completion of the deal .
dynegy ' s earnings for 2002 , before the merger , were expected to range between $ 2 . 50 and $ 2 . 60 . the buyout now raises that to between $ 3 . 40 and $ 3 . 50 , said company spokeswoman jennifer rosser .
according to thomson financial / first call , analysts were expecting dynegy to earn $ 2 . 57 a share next year .
dynegy officials pledged monday that they won ' t tolerate the sort of financial practices that prompted enron to acknowledge last week that it overstated earnings by about 20 percent since 1997 .
those financial practices included business partnerships now under investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
enron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss on oct . 16 and disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to the partnerships . worries about enron ' s financial stability eventually caused shares to plunge 80 percent , leaving enron open for a takeover bid .
officials with both companies said if for some reason the deal falls through , dynegy will be given enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline in compensation for the $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion enron received .
the agreement also has a clause that would allow dynegy to opt out of the deal if enron ' s litigation and other costs surpass $ 3 . 5 billion , dynegy officials said monday .

us equities fell sharply in morning trading after an american airlines jet crashed near new york ' s jfk airport , sparking a nervous selloff on wall street .
two months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the us , the markets were again deeply nervous . a positive opening quickly evaporated following news of the crash , which renewed concerns about safety in the airline industry .
by midsession , the dow jones industrial average was down 166 . 20 to 9 , 441 . 80 while the s & p 500 index fell 15 . 93 to 1 , 104 . 38 . the nasdaq composite lost 23 . 23 to 1 , 805 . 25 .

shares of dynegy inc . shot up 14 percent on monday as investors calculated that the houston - based power - trading company will win big whether or not regulators approve its blockbuster merger with hometown rival enron corp .
under terms of the deal , dynegy executives said in a conference call with analysts on monday , their company will get rights to enron ' s prized northern natural gas pipeline in return for $ 1 . 5 billion invested in enron . moreover , the deal calls for enron to pay dynegy $ 350 million if enron walks away to accept a higher bid from another company .
particularly lucrative for dynegy , analysts said , are the rights it obtained to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the pipeline is an interstate transmission system , providing transportation among other supply conduits and serving customers in the upper midwest through a 17 , 000 - mile network .
for this and other reasons , dynegy stock closed at $ 44 . 31 , up $ 5 . 55 , on the first trading day after the $ 24 billion merger deal was announced .
enron , the nation ' s largest trader of natural gas and electricity , has been bowed in recent weeks by soured transactions with energy partnerships run by one of its former executives and by a revelation about questionable accounting practices . enron last week was forced to revise down its earnings for the past five years and has seen its debt ratings downgraded and its stock price plummet .
but chuck watson , dynegy ' s chief executive , said during the conference call that he did not anticipate any more nasty surprises arising from enron ' s convoluted books . " we literally have taken what we think is the worst case scenario , " watson said . " i ' m comfortable that even in that case this is a very , very good economic transaction for both companies . "
dynegy executives estimated an annual earnings - per - share growth of 15 percent to 20 percent for the combined company over the next three years .
under the stock - for - stock - swap portion of the deal , valued at $ 8 . 85 billion , dynegy is paying the equivalent of $ 10 . 41 a share for the 850 million outstanding enron shares . dynegy would pay . 2685 shares of its stock for each share of enron . in addition , dynegy agreed to assume an estimated $ 13 billion in debt .
it is conceivable that additional problems with enron ' s off - balance sheet partnerships could kill the proposed deal between the two power - trading rivals .
but on monday , kenneth lay , enron ' s chief executive , said : " we don ' t have anything we are trying to hide . on the contrary , we have been very forthcoming of everything we have found . we have disclosed anything and everything that we have found so far . "
despite its sanguine outlook on the deal , dynegy officials acknowledged that they have escape clauses in their offer . for example , dynegy can renege on the deal if pending litigation against enron , which includes a slew of lawsuits filed by disgruntled investors who have lost millions of dollars , exceeds $ 3 . 5 billion in costs .
since last wednesday , when dynegy shares closed at $ 33 , the stock has risen more than 33 percent . after rumors began swirling last thursday that it was in talks with enron , its shares rose to $ 36 . 50 . on friday , after making the bid for enron , its shares closed at $ 38 . 76 , for a rise of 17 . 5 percent in two days of trading .
by comparison , enron stock rose 7 . 1 percent , to $ 9 . 24 , on monday and has risen only 2 percent since last wednesday .
dynegy officials on monday also sought to quell rumors that the deal was greased because enron owed dynegy money . in fact , " dynegy currently owes enron . . . less than $ 50 million , " said rob doty , chief financial officer of dynegy .

uk : innogy restarts energy trading with enron .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
london , nov 13 ( reuters ) - british power company innogy on tuesday said it had resumed trading with crisis - hit u . s . energy group enron after a 14 - day cessation .
in the first confirmation that it had stopped trading with the u . s . group , innogy said in a statement " the situation now seems to have been resolved and business will resume " .
innogy said there had been little impact on it as a result of the suspension of trading .
but industry experts said the implications for enron could be larger because a number of large european energy groups suspended dealings with it at the end of last month .
enron ran into a crisis of investor confidence in mid - october when it disclosed previously unbooked charges , and is now the object of a $ 9 billion rescue takeover offer from smaller rival dynegy .

new york - - shares of enron corp . climbed higher yesterday on investor enthusiasm over last week ' s $ 9 - billion ( u . s . ) bid by rival energy trader dynegy inc . to take over the beleaguered energy giant .
dynegy gained $ 5 . 55 , or 14 . 3 per cent , to $ 44 . 31 on the new york stock exchange , while shares of enron rose 69 cents , or 8 per cent , to $ 9 . 32 . the takeover announced friday halted a free - fall in enron ' s stock that lost about 75 per cent of its market capitalization in the past month .
however , enron ' s stock was trading well below the value of dynegy ' s offer of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for each enron share , which translates into $ 11 . 94 a share . analysts said this likely reflected doubts in some investors minds as to whether the deal , which includes " escape clauses " for dynegy , will go through .
some industry analysts said they were impressed by the upfront details offered by dynegy during a conference call with analysts , an about - face compared with calls with enron . a lack of transparency from enron about its off - balance - sheet transactions , along with a u . s . regulatory investigation , had sparked widespread investor unease .
" i would say that after listening to the conference call , i am even more comfortable with my initial judgment that the projections are conservative , " said jay yannello , an analyst with ubs warburg .
earlier , mr . yannello reiterated a " strong buy " on dynegy , saying while the brokerage does not underestimate the enormous challenge at hand , the takeover should yield the biggest and most credible energy merchant in the world . dynegy is about one - fifth the size of enron when measured by revenues .
enron ' s woes came to light in mid - october after the biggest energy trader in north america disclosed that some of its off - balance - sheet partners contributed to a $ 1 - billion charge and a $ 1 . 2 - billion reduction in shareholder equity .
the takeover is an attractive transaction because of enron ' s trading operations , which combined with dynegy ' s above - board culture based on teamwork , strict values and honesty , should yield a formidable company , mr . yannello said .
however , last week some antitrust lawyers said the deal will be closely examined by the federal trade commission because of the combined company ' s market share in energy trading , said steve newborn , formerly in charge of ftc merger enforcement .
gordon howald , an analyst at credit lyonnais securities , said he is favourably disposed toward the takeover , which he called a " low risk - high reward proposition . "
the most critical component is the immediate $ 1 . 5 - billion equity infusion by dynegy shareholder chevrontexaco corp . into enron that will bolster enron and help keep it viable .
some analysts are less sanguine . they said dynegy is making a big bet that it can successfully clean up enron ' s balance sheet problems as well as integrate its trading and marketing business without losing a lot of key traders and volumes .

a year ago enron , north america ' s biggest natural gas and power business with a growing european presence , chalked up $ 101 billion in revenues and saw its market value reach the giddy heights of almost $ 80 billion .
yesterday it was coming to terms with being part of dynegy , its junior rival in houston , taken out at a price which just allows it to escape the ignominy of the 90 pc club . in less than three weeks the one - time wall street darling has been humbled by a sequence of events that stunned the market and will provide business schools with a classic casebook disaster study .
the enron demise is one which cannot be blamed on the events of september 11 . a third - quarter loss , followed by an equity write - down , the disclosure of questionable off - balance - sheet businesses , an admission that earnings have been over - stated and a securities and exchange commission investigation brought enron to the brink of collapse .
ken lay , its chairman , had taken full advantage of market deregulation to build enron into a multi - national utility with a network of power plants , gas pipelines and a powerful trading presence , in everything from energy to metals . it trades these from an office in victoria which employs 2 , 000 people , and mr lay might have wondered rather earlier how this army of people could possibly pay for themselves , even in his brave new deregulated world .
now dynegy has picked up enron cheaply , and must find its way off debt mountain before the financial weather gets worse . the new group has sales of more than $ 200 billion , and assets in the books at $ 90 billion . a fire sale is inevitable , including that of wessex water , sold to enron for $ 1 . 4 billion three years ago . it will probably not fetch more than $ 400 m today , and even at that price is not obviously cheap .

power major bses , which has evinced keen interest in acquiring a 85 per cent stake in the dabhol power company ( dpc ) , has sought mega power project status for the dabhol project .
" we have suggested this as one of the measures for bringing down the capital cost of the project which , in turn , will translate into lower tariffs . this has been mooted by us at various meetings with the government as well as in the recent meeting with lenders at singapore , " r v shahi , chairman and managing director , bses .
the conferring of such a status will enable the project to bag a slew of tax concessions including reduction in customs duties . it will also enable the plant to sell power across states .

bses is planning to conduct due diligence through an internal task force which will be assisted by a group of consultants .
it is official now that the two parties have evinced interest in acquiring a 85 per cent stake in the project . the industrial development bank of india has officially acknowledged for the first time that the issue was discussed at last week ' s meeting of lenders at singapore .
the institution has said in a press release , " the issues discussed at the meeting included completion of phase - ii of the project and the cost thereof , sale of shareholding by enron corporation , us , bechtel enterprises inc , us , and general electric , us , in dpc ( aggregating 85 per cent of total capital ) to either of the prospective new sponsors viz . bses and tata power . the meetings were fruitful and are expected to pave the way towards the solution to the various issues faced by dpc . "
at the meeting in singapore both the prospective sponsors evinced keen interest in the purchase of enron and its associates ' shareholdings and discussed in detail with ifis as well as enron , several issues relating to the project which would have an impact on the pricing of the shares .
towards this end , brief features of the incentive package prepared by a committee appointed by centre for the purpose , were discussed . the officials of dpc / enron also clarified various technical and operational issues , which would need to be resolved for smooth transfer of management and successful operation of the plant by the new sponsors .

dow jones business news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
the shares of enron corp . and dynegy inc . both rose in heavy trading as investors began trying to digest the possible risks and rewards of dynegy ' s plan to acquire enron in a stock swap with a current value of $ 10 . 12 billion , the wall street journal reported .
in calls and meetings with analysts monday , dynegy chairman chuck watson and enron chairman kenneth lay continued talking up the deal that was announced late friday . " we are confident this is good strategically and financially for dynegy and enron , " said mr . watson , who will serve as chairman and chief executive of the combined entity , to be called dynegy inc .
while the proposed combination faces months of review by government agencies and gives dynegy possible opportunities to cancel the deal , investors ' initial reaction to the merger announcement was positive . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading monday , dynegy ( dyn ) shares were at $ 44 . 31 , up $ 5 . 55 , or 14 % . also on the big board , enron ( ene ) was at $ 9 . 24 , up 7 . 1 % , or 61 cents . both companies were among the most actively traded issues .
under terms of the proposed acquisition , dynegy would give 0 . 2685 of its shares for each enron share . based on dynegy ' s stock price monday , this formula values enron stock at $ 11 . 90 each . enron has about 850 million shares outstanding .
some people raised cautionary notes monday . moody ' s investors service placed dynegy on review for a possible credit - ratings downgrade . standard & poor ' s made a similar move on friday . moody ' s said that while it saw positive elements to the proposed combination , it also believed " the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact dynegy ' s credit fundamentals . "
prudential securities analyst carol coale , who counts herself a fan of dynegy , also worries that enron ' s enormous problems could be a drag on the combined entity . " i don ' t want the dynegy folks to get into something that ' s not good for the company , " she said .
enron in the past several weeks has seen its stock price and standing in the investment community plummet , largely as the result of large - scale transactions it did with partnerships headed by enron officers . those transactions have produced hundreds of millions of dollars of write - offs and restatements in the past month . they are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission and have helped spawn more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits .

usa : dynegydirect , enrononline to trade separately for now .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 12 ( reuters ) - online energy trading leader enrononline will merge with smaller rival dynegydirect after its parent company enron corp . agreed last week to a $ 9 billion takeover by dynegy inc . , dynegy said monday .
the integration of the two platforms will take about six to nine months , dynegy said . in the meantime , the two will continue to operate separately .
" we ' re looking to take the best of both platforms for the integrated company , " said dynegy spokesman john sousa . " ( the emerging platform ) will continue to be based on a one - to - many philosophy as it stands now . "
on both enrononline and dynegydirect traders can only deal with enron and dynegy , respectively .
enrononline is the biggest online energy trading platform in the united states , with a daily average of $ 2 . 6 billion in trades in the past month .
dynegydirect is a much smaller , though growing platform . it recorded nearly $ 10 billion in transactions in the third quarter .
the two platforms offer trading in hundreds of products and services , from crude oil and refined products , to natural gas and electricity . most of the trading is done in u . s . markets , but some european markets are available as well .
enron , currently north america ' s biggest buyer and seller of both natural gas and electricity , agreed to a dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems , including a u . s . regulatory probe into the off - balance sheet dealings , a $ 1 . 2 billion cut in shareholder equity and damaging credit rating downgrades .
however , dynegy can drop its offer if more bad news emerges , or if pending lawsuits against enron lead to more than $ 3 . 5 billion in costs .
dynegy also expressed confidence the takeover will win u . s . regulatory approval and said it does not expect any antitrust concerns to impede the merger of the two electronic platforms .
dynegy shares gained $ 5 . 55 , or 14 . 3 percent , to $ 44 . 31 on the new york stock exchange , while shares of enron rose 61 cents , or 7 percent , to $ 9 . 24 .
the takeover halted a free - fall in enron ' s stock that lost about 75 percent of its market capitalization in the past month .

dynegy bid for enron doesn ' t calm credit concerns , traders say
2001 - 11 - 12 17 : 49 ( new york )
dynegy bid for enron doesn ' t calm credit concerns , traders say
new york , nov . 12 ( bloomberg ) - - some energy traders said
they are still wary of business with enron corp . , which has agreed
to be bought by rival dynegy inc . for about $ 23 billion in stock
and assumed debt .
` ` we ' re continuing to trade with them on a very limited
basis , and we ' ll continue to do so until the proposed dynegy
buyout develops further , ' ' said james peters , a spokesman for
energy trader mirant corp .
traders had scaled back business with enron recently . before
today , its stock had plummeted 90 percent this year . the biggest
energy trader faced a cash crunch and a loss of investor
confidence because of questions about partnerships it started and
put under the control of its senior executives . investors feared
the company was using the partnerships to hide losses and debt .
dynegy said late friday it agreed to buy enron for about
$ 8 billion in stock and $ 15 billion in assumed debt . a quick end
to enron ' s woes is far from assured because the company still is
facing scrutiny from securities , antitrust and energy - market
regulators , executives said .
` ` our credit guys are a still a little nervous ' ' about
dealing with enron , said michael steffes , vice president of
marketing and trading at indianapolis - based aces power marketing
llc , which buys and sells power on behalf of electric cooperatives
in the u . s . midwest . ` ` they ' re relieved that something ' s happened ,
but they haven ' t changed their tack . ' '
two weeks ago , closely held aces decided to halt trading
electricity contracts stretching out two to 10 years with enron ,
steffes said . on friday , it limited trading to same - day or next -
day purchases or sales . the company has no plans to lift those
restrictions now , steffes said .
credit rating
many traders would have banned business with enron if its
credit rating had been downgraded to junk , industry officials
said . as a result , there would have been fewer willing buyers and
sellers in the energy markets , making trades more difficult to
complete . moody ' s investors service on friday lowered its rating
on enron ' s long - term debt to ` ` baa 3 , ' ' one notch above junk .
some gas distributors in the northern u . s . that have long -
term natural - gas supply contracts with enron were lining up
alternate suppliers , according to gelber & associates corp . , an
energy - trading adviser in houston . the companies didn ' t want to
take any chances of an enron default that might leave them short
of gas during the peak of the winter heating season .
` no clear sailing '
` ` you just have to be cautious until there ' s clear sailing , ' '
said charlie sanchez , energy - markets manager at closely held
gelber . ` ` there ' s no indication that there ' s clear sailing here . ' '
some companies that had reduced their dealings with enron in
recent weeks said the merger announcement had helped ease their
credit concerns . spinnaker exploration co . , a gas and oil producer
which had ` ` lightened up ' ' its trading with enron , is now willing
to consider new deals , chief executive officer roger jarvis said .
` ` the merger makes me feel a lot more comfortable ' ' about
doing business with enron , jarvis said . ` ` i don ' t think there is
anything wrong with the enron trading franchise . this is a very
good outcome for them and for the gas business in general . ' '
shares of dynegy surged $ 5 . 55 , or 14 percent , to $ 44 . 31 after
chief executive officer chuck watson told investors the enron
purchase will boost profit by 35 percent next year . enron rose 61
cents to $ 9 . 24 . dynegy , enron and spinnaker are based in houston .
enrononline , the internet trading system , expected more than
5 , 000 transactions today , a 25 percent increase over thursday and
friday , spokesman eric thode said . that ' s 11 percent below the 30 -
day average of about 5 , 600 .
atlanta - based mirant is moving to woo long - term enron
customers still nervous by the firm ' s credit downgrades .
` ` the market ' s a lot bigger than enron , ' ' peters said . ` ` this
merger allows mirant to step up its marketing to long - term
customers who have recently been served by enron . ' '

11 / 12 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 12 ( reuters ) - crude oil marketer and transporter eott energy partners l . p . said on monday that third - quarter profits rose on added benefits from a recent acquisition , but said full - year profits will fall below estimates due as market conditions in the current quarter are weaker than previously anticipated .

eott , which set a recapitalization plan earlier this year , said revenues for the quarter of $ 2 . 3 billion , lower than $ 3 . 1 billion in the prior - year quarter .
eott said it expects to report earnings of between 90 and 94 cents per share for 2001 on weaker - than - expected fourth - quarter market conditions in its crude marketing and pipeline operations . the estimates include a gain of 4 cents per share related to an accounting change recorded in the first quarter .
wall street analysts had been expecting the company to earn in the range of 80 to 95 cents per share with a consensus of 89 cents per share , according to estimates from research firm thomson financial / first call .

dynegy to ask j . p . morgan , salomon to reduce $ 90 mln enron fee
2001 - 11 - 12 17 : 35 ( new york )
dynegy to ask j . p . morgan , salomon to reduce $ 90 mln enron fee
new york , nov . 12 ( bloomberg ) - - charles watson , chief
executive officer of dynegy inc . , wants j . p . morgan chase & co and
salomon smith barney to accept less than the $ 90 million they
charged enron corp . for merger advice .
` ` it sounds a little high , ' ' said watson , whose company
agreed on friday to acquire enron for $ 23 billion in stock and
debt . ` ` if the fees are exorbitant , i ' m going to realign them to
where i think they should be . ' '
salomon and j . p . morgan chase may balk at giving up fees that
people familiar with the transaction said were $ 45 million each
during a year when merger business has plunged 50 percent , bankers
said . the payout is the largest for advising a company to be
acquired this year , according to data compiled by dealogic .
` ` in the current environment , investment banks will be torn
between trying to hold onto fees they ' ve already negotiated and
trying not do anything that would cut into fees in the future , ' '
said brian sullivan , managing partner for financial services at
heidrick & struggles inc . , a recruitment firm .
j . p . morgan chase spokeswoman kristin lemkau and salomon
smith barney spokesman duncan king declined to comment .
while salomon and j . p . morgan chase negotiated their fees
with enron , watson is hoping the firms will accept less in
exchange for the promise of future business . the fees for each
bank are three times the $ 15 million dynegy is paying its adviser ,
lehman brothers holdings inc . , according to people familiar with
the situation . lehman spokeswoman hannah burns declined comment .
record fees
the fees may be higher in part because salomon and j . p .
morgan chase also agreed to extend $ 1 billion in credit to restore
investor confidence . j . p . morgan chase and salomon also offered to
invest another $ 500 million in the combined company , said people
familiar with the transaction .
` ` maybe there were extenuating circumstances , related to
financing , ' ' said tom burnett , president of merger insight , an
affiliate of wall street access inc .
watson said that unlike enron , which was forced to restate
earnings for the past four - and - a - half years and reduce earnings by
$ 586 million , dynegy didn ' t face a cash shortage and so was
unlikely to sell an equity stake to salomon and j . p . morgan chase .
` ` i don ' t want or need their money , ' ' watson said today in an
interview . the two banks ' terms for any investment probably would
be ` ` too expensive , ' ' he said .
enron ' s cash needs until the merger closes , projected in the
third quarter of next year , will be met by the transfer tomorrow
of $ 1 . 5 billion from chevrontexaco corp . , the largest shareholder
in dynegy , and the $ 1 billion credit line from j . p . morgan chase
and salomon , said robert doty , dynegy ' s chief financial officer .
the largest previous investment banking fee for a takeover
announced this year was a $ 50 million fee split by credit suisse
first boston and goldman sachs group inc . for their advice to
wachovia corp . in its $ 13 . 6 billion purchase by first union corp .
morgan stanley got about $ 75 million for advising time warner
in its sale to american online inc . , according to bankers . that
acquisition , which formed aol time warner inc . in january , had a
value of $ 186 billion when it was announced last year .
