Subject: interview for japan office
darren ,
tanya and i had a telephone interview for yumi . i do not know what
kind of position you would offer her .
if you intended to let her do the work on quantitative modeling , her knowledge
in math seems very sallow . she is working on a math degree on stochastic
process , but she can not explain what ito ' lemma is . we also asked questions
about volatility of a basket , value at risk , etc . she did not have a clear
answer .
if you intended to let her to be a junior trader , she might be ok . it seems
she has
some experience of financial market , but i think you are much more qualified
to
probe her than i do in this aspect .
keep in touch ,
best regards
zimin
