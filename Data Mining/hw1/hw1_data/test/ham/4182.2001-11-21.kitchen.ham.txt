one more .
- washington gas : ees has parental guaranty . due to current financial status , washington gas has requested bond instead . rac contact indicated no bond available - ees has 30 days to respond .
a note on the con - ed - services / operations has a work around for the few mid - market deals origination is closing which will prevent us from increasing our security ( straight dual billing ) . mass market volume increase will drive any security increase in this market .
thanks ,
rebecca

after talking with dan , i intend to set up a meeting to provide complete matrices on licensing and utility contracts sometime early during the week beginning dec 3 .
also , just to make sure everyone is clear , harry , gloria , and rebecca are on point during the next few weeks to ensure that that ees and / or epmi responds timely to any request for info , additional security , or other utility matters . this , of course , will continue to require help from legal , credit , and operations .
if anyone has any other questions , please give me a call .
thanks .

i will get with evan and his team and pull this together . of course , much of the activity with utilities is driven by their requirements and judgements ( which change over time ) .

as you are probably aware , the performance and surety bond market is difficult for us to navigate in and around in our current situation . as an example , efs has been shut out of getting access to new bid and performance / payments bonds for its business that requires these . we are addressing this with the bonding companies now . all of their existing bonds are in place and in force .
in light of this , i wanted to make sure that we are absolutely current in all aspects of all bonding requirements with udc ' s and ldc ' s .
please send me the most current copy of your matrix that illustrates where we have existing bonds in place , what drives the capacity requirements , status , renewal / expiration date , current payment status , etc . i would like to make sure that we are all clear on how these work , what triggers increases / decreases in capacity , and other issues impacting our ability to continue to flow electricity and natural gas to our clients .
thanks - dan
