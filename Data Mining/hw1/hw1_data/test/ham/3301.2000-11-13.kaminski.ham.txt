message sent from the pjm - customer - info mailing list at
pjm - customer - info @ majordomo . pjm . com :
the ferc staff recently released a report discussing markets in each of the
regions titled " investigation of bulk power markets " . the report is not a ferc
order .
the northeast region is discussed in a section of 100 pages in length . pjm is
discussed in detail beginning on page 1 - 59 . there are some minor inaccuracies
in
the report with respect to pjm , such as the 1999 peak load .
the report is a good first step in understanding the complex markets in the
northeast and their relationships among each other . the report also contains
recommendations and options for resolution of issues .
the complete report can be found at www . ferc . fed . us / newsl / staffreports . htm
