subject : bridgeline payables and receivables
jean ,
i have attached a schedule that i put together this morning regarding the payables and receivables with bridgeline . these are all of the items that i am aware of at this time .
there are a couple of points from trevor ' s e - mail to brian that i do not agree with . the schedule provided by bridgeline on the ces commission shows outstanding $ 700 , 000 , not the $ 800 , 000 that trevor stated . if september , 2001 is included in his number , it still would be just $ 750 , 000 . also , the amount owed on the pad gas btu conversion is $ 266 , 317 , not $ 274 , 000 . trevor also did not include some of the administrative expenses that bridgeline still owes , it comes to $ 55 , 587 . on the attached schedule , i show that bridgeline owes enron , net , $ 388 , 524 , not $ 226 , 000 .
as i stated earlier , the ces commission payment was coming from bryce baxter ' s group . i am scheduled to talk to the accounting lead for his group this afternoon to find out what has been happening with these payments . i will keep you posted as to what i find out .
at this time , i am not able to confirm the items that trevor included on his schedule . these items were not to be invoiced from this group , so i will have to research further . i have put those items in blue on the schedule .
my comment this morning that what was outstanding with bridgeline was small was based on the items that my group bills out monthly , which would be the $ 9 , 054 disputed amount on the attached schedule . at the time we spoke , i did not realize the significant dollars that trevor claims to owe . we will research these items to see what needs to occur .
please contact me at ext . 36571 with any questions .
thanks ,
karen
