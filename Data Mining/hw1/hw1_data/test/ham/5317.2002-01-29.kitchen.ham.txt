looks like i need to run this passed colette dow to make sure they are ok . can you help me with who you would consider the subs for the names below who are now out from the c list :
alonso , thomas
arora , harry ( replacement greg woulfe )
> aucoin , berney ( potential replacement jim brysch )
> badeer , robert
> choi , paul
> conch , charles
> coulter , edwin
fischer , mark
> gupta , gautam
> herndon , rogers
> keavey , peter
> luce , laura
> mckay , brad
> motley , matt
> o ' neil , murray ( replacement scotty gilbert )
> patrick , micheal ( on list in error should be sherman )
> roberts , mike ( replacement dave ryan )
> robinson , mitch
> rosman , stewart
> ruscitti , kevin
> schweiger , james
> suarez , john
> whitt , mark
if lagrasta and llodra sign a doc of some nature we will be at 81 against a target of 84 .
if we have agreement to switch out about 5 names from above list we are over condition precedent . i talked with greg who believes this is not an issue , but i just as soon have that in writing .

my understanding is " c " s can only be swaped with ubs approval . i
would send a note to colette requesting approval for any names change
in the front office .
thanks
audrey

please let me know your understanding of the deal conditions surrounding the
" c " list . my current estimate is we may just get the required 84 names from the
original list , however , it seems many people from my side have the
understanding tha t :
* where someone on the c list said no , we could substitute names . if this
is the case we have passed the threshold easily .
* that while my piece of paper says 80 % the intent was 70 % . again we
wouldbe done today .
* some of the names are " mistakes " which were never intended to be on
list ( this probably accounts for 4 names at least ) .
obviously , i am keen to report to all that we have achieved the appropriate
signup percentages and that this deal condition is done .
