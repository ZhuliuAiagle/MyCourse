Subject: re : fw : can you ring me when you ' re free
i heard through the grapevine that el paso had an emergency bod meeting on friday . they did . there is some type of retrade underway from the bill wise level . their lead won ' t tell me over the phone but we are scheduled to get together at lunch to discuss . he says he has some ideas . could be a range of things but he seems to be noting timing ( maybe they are tapped out for cash ) .
did not take the chance to tell about the outage . will reveal as approp .
dave - please call larry and find out what is up before i speak with david field
joe henry - could you please do the same with andrew .
