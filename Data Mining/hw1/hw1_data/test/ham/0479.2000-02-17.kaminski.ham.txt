* changing electricity providers : town hall issues
bringing together the elements of regulatory activity , market power and
restructuring to the retail level , this exercise allows the participants to
make active decisions as our experimental " town " weighs the option of
separating from its traditional electricity provider and treading the
waters of competition . our group will assume roles centered around
" regulators , " " power marketers , " the present " investor owned utility " and
the " town " itself . a town meeting will be convened in which each entity is
allowed to present their issues in an effort to persuade municipal
decision - makers that theirs is the best option . embedded in the exercise is
the regulatory and operational framework that is built into the modules
leading up to this participatory segment . frequent references to the basic
materials provided to the workshop participants will be encouraged in the
process of moderating discussions that the workshop facilitators will
implement .
* congestion management
congestion management is one of the most critical components of ercot
implementation . a number of approaches exist for pricing electricity
during periods of high demand . each methodology bears important
consequences for both providors and customers . workshop participants will
participate in construction of a virtual transmission grid and experiment
with different methods of managing congestion .
