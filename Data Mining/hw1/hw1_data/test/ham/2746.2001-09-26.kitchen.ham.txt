we haven ' t lost the smurfit deal yet , but the client believes it is taking us too long to clarify our credit parameters for this deal .
the individuals in bill bradford ' s group are extremely qualified and hard working . there are just not enough of them . we greatly appreciate your considering if additional resources are needed .
