pretty much correct . actual is :
curry $ 20 , 439 , 468
sukaly $ 0 ( somehow 4 midmarketing deals i did got credited to sukaly so i moved the $ 27 , 602 to me ! )
ahn $ 12 , 181 ( associate )
jester $ 10 , 000 ( just started in group a couple of months ago )
doug gilbert - smith supported me from the trading side to help get the wind deal done and he has been paid 50 % of its value $ 18 mm . no one else was working with me on the wind deal other than support groups . portz in legal was instrumental in getting the contract done with enron wind . edith cross and greg trefz in structuring also pulled long nights to get the deal approved .
thanks , - mike
