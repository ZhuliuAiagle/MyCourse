Subject: origination meeting
louise :
i unfortunately was not able to attend your meeting this morning as i was interviewing analyst candidates , however the overall reaction from the group seems to be positive and i applaud you for your efforts in setting the tone .
i realize the company is in an interesting position with respect to liquidity and therefore i felt compelled to pass this thought by you with respect to a potential avenue power origination could pursue to assist with the current situation . since most of our activities seem to require some amount of capital , i was wondering whether you felt a viable strategy would be to turn carl tricoli ' s prepay concept for ipp ' s on its head and reverse the transaction with one or more counterparties where we pick up the upfront premium and deliver power in the future . assuming we can find the right counterparties , then we in essence would achieve a short position ( which seems to be more in line with your strategic thoughts ) and pick up liquidity in the short run .
regards ,
charlie
