Subject: re : trading algorithms
andy ,
sounds good . one comment : vasant is swamped with work coordinating
several high profile projects .
bob is very productive and thorough and will get a lot of support
internally from other members of the group : this contribution
may not be directly visible but it will be still very important .
we appreciate your hands - on involvement . it ' s always the most
important condition of a successful project to have direct and frequent
interaction
with the customer . look fwd to working on this project .

subject : trading algorithms
guys ,
here is what i took away from our meeting :
1 ) . research will continue working on custom reporting off of enrononline
data .
2 ) . research will continue working on market analysis off of enrononline data
3 ) . research will a contribute a resource to the trading algorithm effort ,
presumably one at this point in time . i would prefer it to be vasant but i am
flexible . the trading algorithm group will be run by the enrononline team with
its product reviewed by research . it is my belief that projects like this
require a firm commercial hand in their infancy to make sure they stay on the
right track .
if this presents a problem for anyone please let me know so that we can
discuss .
thanks ,
andy
