information about the talks and the speakers
dr . curt hunter

dr . hunter ' s discussion is entitled " lessons learned from recent global
financial crises . " since 1990 , major banking and currency crises have
occurred in many countries around the world - including mexico and latin
america in 1994 , east asia in 1997 - 98 , and russia and brazil in 1998 ,
among others - with large costs both to the individual countries
experiencing the crises and to other nations . as a result , considerable
effort has been expended by economists and policymakers to identify the
causes of these crises and to design programs with the aim of preventing ,

the costs when they do occur . this talk reviews the key lessons
policymakers have learned from these recent episodes and highlights the
role that risk management plays in crisis prevention .
