Subject: re : swaps monitor research .
vince ,
i reviewed all information available on the web site . there is a template
that shows what kind of data swapsmonitor provides on commodities , but
unfortunately this template is a blank one and no example of the table given .
to receive any actual data we have to subscribe to their service ( $ 200 -
single delivery , $ 300 - annual subscription ) .
below is the template that given for commodity derivatives :
the data in this database is derived from audited financial statements ,
regulatory filings , reports to shareholders .
i will be glad to write a summary report .
sincerely ,
elena
