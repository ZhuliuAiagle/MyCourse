Subject: meritocracy presentation
louise ,
i spent time today and this past weekend surfing the web on " meritocracy " / " meritocracy and management " etc . therefore , using different phrases to capture the following information :
benchmarks for meritocracy
relevant managment issues related to meritocracy , and
meritocracy within a large firm .
overall , i was disappointed by what i found . seems that everyone has their own perspective on meritocracy and much is not related to business ( i . e . - how it relates to the domestic educational system , sat tests , diversity , etc . ) anyhow , i aggregated information that i felt transferred most to the enron culture and attached some slides at the end of your presentation . no pride of ownership , edit at will .
i plan on stopping by a bookstore tomorrow evening . i have to film our prc video today .
regards , mrha
