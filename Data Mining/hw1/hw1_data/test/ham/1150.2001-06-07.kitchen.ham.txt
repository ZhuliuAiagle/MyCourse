wait until louise gets back . these should not be big . ie 50 and 125 at most . i ' m not even sure that irvine is the right guy in the end .

seems to me a sensible move quickly on steve irvine and jaime williams to get contracts in place following yzaguirre ' s departure . i believe jaime ' s contract has just expired and irvine we drafted back in april as part of the blitz approach but never got past the " do yzaguirre first " obstacle .
what do you think ? you want to talk with them or should we go direct to them ?
