Subject: re : good morning
john ,
it does not sound silly to me . i don ' t get that many opportunities to sit
down
with those guys in a relaxed atmosphere and chat .
i shall read the notes and get back to you . i have just come back from
philadelphia and have to catch up with a few things .

subject : good morning
vince ,
i know that you are in philadelphia today but wanted to ship you my " first
pass notes " before i leave town in the morning . please edit / add to or
delete anything you think is appropriate . my objective in the notes is
just to get things down on paper before too much time has passed . when i
place something in quotes this indicates a direct quote .
i ' ll give you a call next week when i get back to town . thanks again for a
truly memorable experience . i plan to frame jeff ' s enron model . it may
sound silly to you guys but we academics really appreciate opportunities
like the one i got on monday . what a truly spectacular day .
take care ,
john
p . s . andy gave me his note care describing the demand for a peaking plant
but i wasn ' t able to get him to sign it . i hope i did not offend him by
asking for his signature on that silly graph . after i left his office it
occured to me that he might think i was making light of him . please
explain to him that i was not and will treasure his simple model as
capturing the essence of optionality in a real asset .
