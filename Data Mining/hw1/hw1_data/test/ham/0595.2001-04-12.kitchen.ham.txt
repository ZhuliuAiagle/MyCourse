Subject: advanced mobile power
enron has two mobile units that are available for placement in customer deals or in pure merchant sites . these are 22 mw , trailer - mounted and are being refurbished / packaged for delivery qiii , 2001 . in general , these units will be high heat rate , high emissions , but are cheap and available .
in order to streamline the process and facilitate information flow , i have asked jim buerkle to be responsible for placing these machines into income producing deals in the wscc . he will evaluate site alternatives , work with the enron groups that control these machines and structure the commercial deals . please forward any opportunities to jim . if these units get placed profitably , we will likely step up to manufacture more units available for summer 2002 .
regards ,
chris
