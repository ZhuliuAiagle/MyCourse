Subject: management of george
hi louise ,
with the copy of the procedures that i gave you i think we have covered who can suspend george . however i am still trying to figure out who is responsible for determining when to shut it down . i was wondering if you know whether greg whalley is still going to be responsible for managing the product or has it been turned over to the crude group .
also were you serious when you said you wanted the suspend trading button back . thanks .
