Subject: weekend efforts to translate core / noncore proposal into legislative
language
below is an update from the weekend ' s activities .
the group negotiating the core / noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language / format .
the product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill - drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today . he will distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow ( pdt ) .
the plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to hertzberg by cob tomorrow ( monday ) .
as expected , some in the group are attempting to " recontract " certain portions of the original deal , but those attempts are generally at the margin .
the dwr contracts remain a key impediment to any deal .
senator burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to davis .
in addition , the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by dwr ( and de - link the bonds from the dwr contracts ) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially .
will have more information tomorrow on where burton and the bond legislation stand .
best ,
jeff
