hello !
congratulations on your new arrival - hope you are all well . got married on 26 may and got sunshine in dublin on the day !
we are running the virtual entry capacity as an auction
? bids due in on 9 july ( may be extended if transco delay their auction )
? 5 year minimum term
? any terminal
? we have right to refuse gas at the beach on payment of compensation chosen by customer in the bid .
we are still running analysis to produce beach curves based but current thinking is that
? current market inefficiency is inflating the price ( we are currently buying day ahead interruptible fergus capacity at 0 . 3 p and buying gas as it turns firm on the day at nbp - 7 p )
? our aim is to take out the conservative guys in our auction so the transco auctions should be less ridiculous ( summer max price was 12 p but the average was 6 p , with wide spreads in each auction round
? we have modelled with transcost to verify transco ' s view that fergus can be expanded by 50 % for 1 p / th lrmc
also we have some other risk management angles we intend to pursue if we end up with a large position
? offer underwriting on incremental investment by transco
? code modifications to increase capacity auctioned
? build a pipeline !
it would be great to get your views on it - shall i give you a call when we ' ve pulled together the curve analysis ?
