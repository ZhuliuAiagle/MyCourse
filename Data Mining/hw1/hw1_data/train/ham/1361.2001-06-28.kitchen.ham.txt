subject : contract approvals
i gave all the signed contract approvals to kim melodick as david is out . i have signed them all but david hasn ' t . i have kept all the original numbers as submitted by chris and expect david to sign on this basis ( ie original chris numbers not david ' s changes ) .
please sort out drafting for chris .
thanks
louise
