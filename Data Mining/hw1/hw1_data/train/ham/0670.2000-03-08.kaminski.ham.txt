Subject: packet analysis software
hi stinson , as per our discussion , here is the e - mail from jim on the
subject . i convinced jim that this type of modeling effort is our gig and he
completely agrees . as per jim ' s suggestion , he and i will talk more on the
product while we are in denver . i suspect that we will arrange for the vendor
to come to houston and do a presentation on the product and install the
product on our machines . as for additional development we should get john
bloomer and jim together in a meeting and hash out the requirements from john
bloomer ' s perspective .
using vince ' s analogy , this tool allows us to deternime the size of the cargo
space needed for fedex - like delivery ( our streaming media products ) . whereas ,
the optical light path switching ( ds - 3 , oc - 3 , oc - 12 and oc - 48 ) based trading
will reserve the underlying airline routes , etc . so the packet based stuff
is looking at the required capacity from ip layer ( network and transport :
level 3 and 4 ) requirements . the optical light path is level 1 & 2 based
requirements . that is this tool will allow john bloomer to size ( actually we
will do the analysis for him ) the capacity requirement that he would need for
the products that he is developing .
that is my take on the difference , we ' ll find out otherwise .
once i finish off this discussion with jim in denver , i suggest putting
martin lin on the job to find out more about the product and do the leg work
to arrange for vendor demo and software installation . martin will keep samer
and chonawee updated on the information that he gathers . martin please start
checking on the web about this company and other similiar produts . i will get
you contact number for ebs and the vendor as soon as jim provides them to
me .
avici uses this product . avici is a next generation router vendor that is
selling terabit routers . ebs is an investor in that company .

attached is an overview of what opnet technologies itdg and modeler ( v ) 7 . 0
offers out of the box . as previously mentioned , we have purchased this s / w
and are discussing potential co - development of module ( s ) currently not
supported . my belief is we can spin up a couple of your studs and develop
our own stuff faster @ a fraction of the cost . avici , used opnet to develop
a circuit emulation model for their tsr and cisco used opnet for mpls and dpt
modeling . these guys are willing brides at this point . we just need to
clearly identify their role in the network performance management and
modeling space . we will have to talk more in denver .
my flight arrives @ 10 : 00 ish and i am told that rental cars are scarce .
