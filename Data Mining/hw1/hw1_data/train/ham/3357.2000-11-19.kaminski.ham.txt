Subject: re krishnarao , pinnamaneni v review
i made a mistake and put comments for another person into krishnar ' s prc .
please make sure that you ignore it if i can ' t get it fixed . below is what i
intended to put in . my apologies .
i will get my assistant to get it deleted and put this information in on
monday . it won ' t let me do it now . i guess it does not pay to leave 30 or
40 reviews to the last day . paula : please fix this for me and let vince know
either that it is fixed or cannot be fixed .

he could do to help us out .
analystical technical
excellent . krishnar has a very strong grasp of what we are doing and how it
should be done .
overall
excellent . my interactions with krishnar have been limited but positive .
krishnar is always positive with a positive attitude to get the job done .
strengths :
very strong analytical skills with a desire to add value .
areas for improvements
i don ' t understand krisnar ' s role ( is leading all research people on our
floor or just some ) well and have had limited interaction with him . { all has
been positive when it has ocurred } this suggests that krishnar might spend
more time define what his people are doing and getting feedback about their
performance , and developing the project scope better .
