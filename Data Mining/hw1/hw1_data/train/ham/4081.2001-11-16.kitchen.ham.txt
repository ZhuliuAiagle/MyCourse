frank ,
i wanted to let you know that we recently closed an innovative , " first of its kind " transaction with connectiv . the multi - year deal involved our pjm demand swaps , whereby connectiv financed the purchase of a strip of monthly calls with the sale of multi - year puts . this was an important transaction for us as it confirmed the viability of our demand swap product .
of particular note , gil worked closely with partho ghosh ( from the weather desk ) during the entire sales process . it was gil who identified connectiv as a viable target and he made the initial introductions . he also provided insight into connectiv ' s decision making process as the deal unfolded . he was a great help throughout and we look forward to working with gil on the other opportunities he has identified .
i just wanted to provide you with this quick update and , as always , we look forward to working with you and your team . thanks .
bill
