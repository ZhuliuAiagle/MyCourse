Subject: uk inflation and storage model
hi zimin ,
inflation :
i am also spending a lot of time looking at short - term auto - regressive models
for ppi and long - term , more fundamentally - based models . this work is
important because we have potentially a large positive p & l that may be
unlocked by moving to our new indicative uk ppi curves . john sherriff and
trena are keen that any models i produce are vetted / approved in houston , so i
will forward to stinson or yourself initially for review once ready and
documented .
storage :
thanks for the current storage model . due to the complexity of the
modelling issues involved , i would strongly support a visit by you to help me
meet the needs of the london customers in this matter , and am happy to act as
the anchor for information flow in the mean time .
regards ,

subject : us inflation and storage model
anjam ,
thanks a lot . after getting that book i will redo the us inflation model .
our exposure
to cpi inflation risk is huge ( think about how many contracts signed by ees ) ,
so the
us model is very important .
the storage model is going through aduit by prof . d . duffie . we are adding
features
to it . i can send you the current version . maybe it is worthwhile for me to
go to london
to discuss with the users about the valuation .
