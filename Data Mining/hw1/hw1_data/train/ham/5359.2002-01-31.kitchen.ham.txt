Subject: fw : revised marketing list
louise ,
attached is the list of top 50 counterparties .
as mentioned in my prior emails , and mentioned by credit in our meeting this morning :
credit have a list ( the one you previously supplied ) , but have been frustrated in that the list shows only group names and does not show the specific legal entities within the group name whom we need to approve ( e . g . aquila risk management corp vs . aquilla capital and trade ) .
attached is a list which we put together which was taken from the top 50 power and top 50 gas customer lists , based on online transactions .
further work needs to be done to add back the actual power ranking and prioritise based on total value of business between both gas and power , and to prioritise the sub - entities , but this should give you an idea of what we hope to have ready to send to credit tomorrow .
i ' m trying to reconcile how giving them this list helps at this late stage , but they have requested it , so i intend to provide it tomorrow , unless you have any objections .
