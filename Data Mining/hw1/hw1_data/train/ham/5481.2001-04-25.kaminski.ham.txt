molly ,
giuseppe is finishing his ph . d . at stanford and worked for us last summer . we would like to make him an offer to bring him as a manager . vince would like to offer $ 110 k base plus a $ 20 k signing bonus and whatever would be the appropriate relocation package ( he is single . ) . he is leaving on monday for europe , so it would be preferable if we can get an offer letter in his hands by friday or saturday . i have verbally given him this offer already , but told him that you would be the expert regarding what is covered in the relocation part . he should be sending me his current address by email which i will forward to you a . s . a . p .
thanks ,

subject : re : from stinson
stinso , nice to hear from you . things are going well here . the only
annoyance comes from the ins . i applied for curricular practical
training , and it will take about three months to have the work permit .
receiving an h - 1 takes understably much longer . other than this , i would
like to know how are things in the research group and ebs .
i will leave for italy next monday and will stay there two weeks . i hope
to hear from you before my departure .
