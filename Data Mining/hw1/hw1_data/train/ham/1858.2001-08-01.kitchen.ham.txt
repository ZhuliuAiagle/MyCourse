chad ,
answers to questions ( clearly not enron answers but my own personal
views )
1 . the areas you are looking at are not directly commercial and this
should be something you consider . essentially you may wish to consider
a consultancy company which is much more akin to your interests which
are not our core competencies . you need to decide whether you wish to
pursue a commercial career or not - decide what your risk profile is , a
consultant role is low reward , low risk and commercial player has a
high / risk reward profile .
2 . driven , enthusiastic , hard working , highly analytical , personable and
motivated .
3 . not having an mba personally , i find this one simple to answer . too
much occupation with trying to apply theory to practice / not seeing the
wood for the trees ( english expression ) .
4 . get some practical experience .
5 . more case studies ( harvard business ) .
good luck .
