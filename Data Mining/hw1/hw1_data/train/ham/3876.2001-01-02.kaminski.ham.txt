Subject: happy new year , and some new year ' s resolutions
with the new year , we would like to institute some rules within the research
group . this applies to everybody in research and is at the express request
of vince , but i am just sending it to my reports ( and their reports ) as of
now .
people are expected to report to work in the morning around 8 : 00 am to 8 : 30
am but no later than 8 : 30 am . this is primarily because our clients from
other groups typically start calling around 8 : 00 am and we need to be
responsive . of course , once in a while if something urgent comes up then
this may be relaxed but you are responsible for letting both your supervisor
and your assistant ( anita and / or shirley ) know in advance .
i am trying to come up with a schedule that will allow me to get updated on
all the work that you guys are doing , and i will probably set this up next
week after vince finishes drawing up the overall directions for the group for
2001 .
thanks ,
vasant
