steve kean and i finally got to discuss this the other day and we decided
that this effort would likely be too time consuming and costly , particularly
for certain key employees , to justify doing it . it obviously is an
interesting topic but one that would require alot of attention ( and possibly
money ) to participate in fully . thanks for your attention to this .
