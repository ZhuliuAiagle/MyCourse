Subject: longview dash
louise ,
chip will want to talk with you about the longview equipment . we are circulating a dash to enable us to continue making payments . if we do not continue to make payments , we forfeit the equipment and take a $ 23 mm hit . this is approximately 35 % of the total equipment contract . i think the equipment is worth more ( than 65 % ) and i believe that we will get out of this problem with less than a $ 22 mm hit . i therefore recommend that we commit the extra $ for this equipment . it will continue to be funded off b / s .
we continue to have discussions / negotiations with calpine , nrg and transalta . we have also opened up general equipment discussions with mirant and aes .
regards ,
chris calger
