here ' s the story .
research forwarded to their personnel a solicitation they received for java
training by an outside person , weeklong classes for true beginners and for
those with decent programming experience in other languages ( esp c + + ) . vince
had pre - agreed tlo pay for it for anyone who wanted it . but , the response
they got was so " overwhelming " they reconsidered , for financial reasons , and
decided it would be better to just hire a professor to teach a class for a
week here . the costs would be around $ 15 , 000 , and there should be room for
around 15 people in the class . they have 6 - 8 people , and wonder if we might
have some people who would want to do it ( a no - brainer - java is a big - time
resume pad these days ) and would be willing to share the costs with them .
what is your opinion on this ? personally , i think it ' s a relatively
inexpensive investment in our people , although , selfishly , it does increase
their ' market value ' so to speak . ( of course , nothing keeps directors from
going to the class as well : ) )
