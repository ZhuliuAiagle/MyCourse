hi vince ,
i was not aware of the " power play " book tour . i ' ll check it out .
as to the article with the baylor professor , i think it ' s a great idea . i ' d
like the university affairs team to get involved . if a visit is required ,
interviews , etc . , they should coordinate . that way , i think we ' ll have the
greatest opportunity to leverage the relationship .

mark ,
two points .
1 . you probably know about it already . abhay mehta , the author of " power
play " , is on a
tour of the united states . please , take a look at the information about a
meeting last sunday
at stanford university . the web site address is given below . my wife went to
the presentation and told me it was quite critical about enron . about 40
people attended .
2 . i was approached by john martin , a professor of finance at baylor , to
write jointly an
academic paper on enron for a financial journal . he wanted to work on an
article on ebs .
i have suggested a different topic : enron - case study of a company
reinventing itself .
i made a few points to john :
a . enron ' s evolution did not just happen by accident .
it was a result of implementation of a far - reaching
strategy developed by the management .
b . in the process of its evolution enron changed its environment . i came up
with a term
" proactive evolution " , as opposed to " reactive evolution . "
c . the strategy included many elements , including emphasis on the quality
of human resources , changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee
empowerment .
d . there are very few companies that match enron ' s experience and
accomplishemnts .
the paper could become a standard reading at the mba courses on corporate
strategy
and would help greatly our recruiting efforts .
writing the paper would require interviews with ken , jeff and a few other key
players .
let me know what you thing about it . john is really excited about this paper .
