attached is my revised gain calculation for pioneer chlor . the amount has been changed to a gain on sale of $ 710 , 619 . 31 . this along with the interest income for the third quarter of $ 250 , 299 . 86 gives a total p & l amount for the third quarter ( net to ena ) of $ 960 , 919 . 17 .
please let me know if you disagree with my calculation or if you have any questions .
