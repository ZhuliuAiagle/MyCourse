raymond cote is vice president , financial engineering at finrad inc . , a
montreal - based consulting firm offering financial management solutions that

abstract :
liquidity risk , as opposed to credit and market risks , has received little
attention in professional or academic journals . we argue that analyzing bank
liquidity risk can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis . after
introducing some concepts and definitions , the presentation defines a
framework allowing to measure a bank ' s structural liquidity risk . it then
shows that combining the framework with modern credit risk measurement tools
leads to a liquidity risk var measure . the presentation then offers
concluding comments on the integration of the liquidity risk measurement
framework within enterprise - wide risk management .
