Subject: iif / oxan - info sources
vince ,
we would like to continue to receive the iif service for a cost to the
research group of $ 15 , 000 per annum . can i ask you to approve this charge ?
please let me know if you ' d like to discuss . we decided to cancel the oxford
analytica service ( daily country briefs and access to the website ) as we are
getting consensus forecasts for fx and inflation from another source , so we
will not be subject to the $ 10 , 000 fee referenced below .
thanks ,
gwyn

hi maureen and gwyn -
on the oxford analytica front , i ' m glad you have found the service useful .
our contract with them has expired and we are currently negotiating for more
users to have access . our current contract is for $ 50 k or $ 10 k per user per
year . we can charge $ 10 k back to you .
on the iif front , the invoice for $ 47 k is due at the end of the month . here
i would propose that we pay two thirds ( to cover our costs and the costs of
our competitive analysis colleagues in london ) , leaving $ 15 k for you to cover .
since we took on these services last year , we have expanded our range of
sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less . thus i
need to allocate some of our costs from oxan and iif to other projects .
let me know what you think about this proposal . maureen , congratulations on
your secondment to enron metals ( gwyn mentioned it to me ) . fyi , our
colleague jim roth is providing competitive analysis support to joe gold and
john sherriff on that project from london .
