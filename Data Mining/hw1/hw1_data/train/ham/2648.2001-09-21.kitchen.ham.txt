Subject: good news
louise ,
some good news for the weekend .
1 . unocal wants to enter into a loi within the next 2 - 4 weeks based on a term sheet presented to them this september . it is a storage / transport / compression deal being led by ned higgins . ( look in your compression section , upstream products folder for more details . )
2 . eva rainer has received four bids for the napoleonville . at a minimum , we call sell all 330 acres , get it off the balance sheet and still make $ 800 , 000 . eva wants to do a counter proposal of $ 8500 / acre . how badly do you want to get this deal done this quarter ?
julie is going to come in on sunday to look at my storage / transport presentation . i plan also getting feedback from regional gas heads ( luce / tyc / vickers ) as well as neal and hunter before meeting with lavo on monday afternoon . i guess i will have a busy weekend and monday , but i think it will be well worth it . i have already briefly spoken to hunter / neal today - neal is a much bigger supporter - shively will do whatever lavo wants . i would also like to show you the presentation prior to the meeting with john .
don ' t worry - i already have next friday registered as a vacation day .
regards , mrha
