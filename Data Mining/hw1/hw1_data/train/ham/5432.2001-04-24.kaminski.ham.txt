hi amitava ,
we ' ve been doing some thinking and discussing here regarding the information
on our modelling process we ' ll provide to darryl duffie . we think it would
be extremely valuable for iris to come out to london for a couple weeks to
gain a better understanding of the how the models integrate and are truly
employed . i think this would greatly enhance the " product " we ' ll send to
duffie as well as giving iris a firm view of enron credit . in addition , she
could also explore some of the data sources such as amadeus and others that
might be helpful in private firm modelling . if we ' re extremely
efficient / lucky in receiving data from d & b or experian , she might be able to
begin analysis on that for the private model efforts .
i would recommend she plan on coming out for 2 weeks starting the week of 30
apr perhaps . depending on the progress with the private firm data sources ,
it probably makes sense to send her back to houston to work on calibration
sets with a likely return visit to london as required .
please let me know your thoughts .
cheers ,
scott
