vince ,
please find attached a small note i had prepared at wade ' s request . the note
is to be used for a private meeting of the ex - chairman of mseb with the
governor of maharashtra . in the indian system , the governor represents the
federal government in the state . hence any information he gathers is for the
central govt .
this informal note is to be passed to him . the focus as you will see is to
see if we can engage the central govt . through this route .
krishna is here and sends his regards .
regards ,
sandeep .
