Subject: allegheny / nepco
the " bid " is for an epc contract with the equipment . the implied bid for the equipment is - $ 16 . 7 mm . the implied margin in the epc contract is $ 32 mm plus $ 11 mm of contingency . if the risk / reward on the epc contract is reasonable , then this seems like a great deal . at the same time , we will attach a turbine loi to the epc loi making it clear to allegheny that we can offer the turbines on a stand alone basis . should we offer at the $ 10 mm discount or are you ok with - $ 16 . 7 mm ? ben and i would hit a - $ 16 . 7 mm bid . this would probably close this in january , but we ould try to get a turbine down payment in december .
