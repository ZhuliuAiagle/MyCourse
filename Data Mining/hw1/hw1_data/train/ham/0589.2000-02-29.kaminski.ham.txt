ravi :
since you are spending time with jim irvine , can you find out what martin lin
needs to do to start coming up to speed in supporting jim ? martin is ready
to transition , but needs to find out what he will be working on . will jim
be in houston anytime soon or should martin go to portland to talk to him ,
etc . . .
