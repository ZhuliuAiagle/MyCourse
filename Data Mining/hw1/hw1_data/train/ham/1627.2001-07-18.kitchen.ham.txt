Subject: fw : redmond responsibilities
as brian is away on vacation , i thought you may be able to assist me .
brian redmond does not have responsibilities in his profile for the md prc . i took laura luce ' s profile and changed the region to texas and added tech services . do you think this is appropriate or can you offer any changes ?
