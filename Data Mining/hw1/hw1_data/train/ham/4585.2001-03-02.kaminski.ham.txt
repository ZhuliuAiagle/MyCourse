Subject: web based expense report implementation deadline
xms communication
the expense management system ( xms ) is a tool used to electronically submit
your expense report for approval and payment through the enron intranet . it
is user friendly , accurate and less labor intensive for you and our
accounting staff . this product was initially made available october 15 , 2000
and approximately 50 % of the houston employees are currently using it to
submit their expense reports . our goal is to have all enron employees using
the xms system by april 15 ( income tax day  * easy to remember ) .
there are some changes coming to the accounts payable ( ap ) department that
are compelling us to fully utilize the xms system . in the near future paper
and e - mail directed expense reports will not be accepted . if you are unsure
of how to use the xms system there is training available through leap that
will explain how to use the system . the following training information is
