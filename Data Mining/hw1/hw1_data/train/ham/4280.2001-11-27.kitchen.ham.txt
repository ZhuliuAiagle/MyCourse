Subject: lrci board
jean , we have appointed three new directors for lrci , inc . they are yourself , mark haedicke , and brian redmond . the records show the current directors as mark haedicke and louise kitchen , but we were unable to find any resolutions supporting this . we will clean the records up to reflect the new directors . since you and brian are on the management of bridgeline , it is a more logical fit for you to be directors . the resolutions for the napoleonville land sale with the new directors are being circulated for signature . you may have already seen it . let me know if you have any questions . thanks .
