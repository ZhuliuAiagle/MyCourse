Subject: re : transfers to netco
information regarding specific trades can not be transferred due to ( i ) confidentiality provisions with counterparties and ( ii ) with respect to power , the need for ferc approval . everyone seems to be comfortable that the identity of counterparties can be disclosed , as well as the counterparties contact information and aggregated trade data not associated with any particular counterparty . consequently , the software going to netco will be cleansed of the trade data and individual ' s data bases and files should be similarly cleansed .

paula corey has informed that the it people say it would be impossible to delete all prior trade data from " to be netco " employees '
h drive
existing e - mail
home directory
the recommendation is to wipe these clean prior to netco employees obtaining access to them . further , the recommendation was made that people not be warned to avoid cheating . i do not know if not telling people is fair . however , absent some other solution , it would appear that deleting this information would be advisable . would you be the person to instruct the it people to delete and / or announce to " to be netco " employees that this will occur ?
