while the thought is still on my mind , so you want think i ' m

what i am thinking we could do is send the move team , help desk and
facilities
complimentary donuts from the research group during the holiday season .

hello vince and mike
i want to keep you informed .
this year all baskets will be done in a timely manner .
on last year we were going through a major move therefore
many people played key roles in keeping us together .
this year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone .
i am sending a lists of who we have so far .
there are a few names on the list that i feel we should do something else
for this year .
under shirley ' s list of names .
( not so expensive )
they are : move team who ?
mail room who ?
facilities help desk who ?
there are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them .
please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e - mail so far
i will need your approval for all baskets , however your input on the matter
will be
greatly appreciated . the list is not completed i am still waiting for
additions .
thanks
kevin moore
