Subject: valuation methodology
we ' ve had a request from aa to provide them with some sort of write - up or documentation from our research group on the valuation methodology used on the contingent issuance instrument for 18 million shares that was a part of the raptor transaction completed at the end of march . apparently , this request has come from aa ' s expert in this area ( i believe that his name is dechundra , or something like that . i ' ve probably destroyed the spelling on that . you guys are probably very familiar with him . ) anyway , is there such documentation that we can provide them easily ? if so , let me know so that we can try to get aa finished with their review of the transaction . in talking to our contacts at aa , i believe that their expert will be wanting to talk to you after he reviews the methodology documentation . thanks ,
