Subject: teco update
we received their redraft of the doc yesterday , it needed a lot of work . we will return the draft on monday morning . we are combining the qse contract into the energy management agreement . in addition , there is a master purchase agreement as well . this results in quite a bit of legal work . teco indicated they are undermanned at this time and the turnaround will be slow . from a business concept standpoint we really don ' t have any " deal killer " issues . i think we can get the deal done by the quarter ' s end at the latest and probably late next week . but then depends on teco ' s turnaround time . stuart zisman and mark haedicke are going to meet with lavo on wednesday to talk legal risks associated with this deal and these types of deals . i ' ll be there and i ' ll let you know the time in case your are interested .
