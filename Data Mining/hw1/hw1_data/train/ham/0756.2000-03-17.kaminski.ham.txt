Subject: oracle nt client software upgrade - manual upgrade steps
this weekend , the enron global information technologies department will be
distributing a new version of the oracle 8 i client . due to the mobile
environment of our user base , not all machines will receive the automatic
update . if you are a user of an oracle based application and your machine is
not available to the network this weekend , you can manually upgrade your
machine via the following steps :
1 ) click on start - programs - utilities
2 ) then click on " install oracle 8 i client " .
if you are a user of microsoft excel spreadsheets or microsoft access
databases that retrieve information from our oracle databases , you can
manually convert your oracle odbc connections to the proper drivers via the
following steps :
1 ) click on start - programs - utilities
2 ) then click on " update odbc data source names to oracle 8 i " .
if you do not see these icons , there is another icon under start - programs -
utilities called " update start menu " that will re - populate your start menu .
thank you for your co - operation -
