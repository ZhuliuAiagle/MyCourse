becky ,
i gave the % % for egm to shirley . i assume she communicated this info to you
already .
i assume egm includes f / x - i / r ( gary hickerson ) , weather , insurance ( jere
overdyke ) ,
oil trading and coal .
for calme i don ' t have any info . let ' s split the cost evenly .

subject : research allocation
shirley ,
grm is now with egm group . egm wants to verify that the 17 . 5 % we are going
to allocate to grm is for the insurance , jere overdyke group . egm seems to
think that their weather , mark tawney group , is receiving support from
research . also , can we break out the support for calme ? calme is going to
split into 3 bus and i am trying to determine who i need to bill for research
supports . if you have any questions , call me . thanx .
