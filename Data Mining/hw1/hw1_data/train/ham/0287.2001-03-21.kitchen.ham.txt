Subject: gtv ii update
louise ,
i would like to give you an update of gtv ii inception document . i have obtained the signatures from most people on the sign - off sheet except colleen sullivan , philippe bibi , beth perlman , and dave nommensen , colleen has been out . philippe and beth both have been out this week . dave nommensen did not want to sign the document . he felt that he could not sign it without having been involved in the requirement gathering or project estimations . last week when we were working on the new requirements and the project estimate , dave was on his spring - break vacation .
i will try to get philippe and beth ' s signatures when they are back early next week .
the development has started today . i will keep you updated on the progress of the development .
regards
zhiyong
