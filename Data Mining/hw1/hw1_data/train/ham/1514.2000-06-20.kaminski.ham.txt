vince ,
greetings , and thanks for your 6 / 12 e - mail .

i thank you once again for your invitation and look forward to my visit
this wed . my current schedule calls for a hobby arrival on wed . at 6 : 23
p . m . , in time for the dinner scheduled for that evening . ( i can take a cab
directly to the restaurant if you ' re scheduling a circa 6 : 45 - 7 p . m .
dinner . ) further , i have tentatively set up the thur . return flight to
austin at 3 : 38 p . m . , and that can be modified as desired .
> please , make a reservation at hyatt regency downtown or double tree
> downtown ( there are several hotels with the same names ) .
when i made the room reservation last mon . 6 / 12 , it turned out that these
hotels showed no vacancy ( is there a conference in town ? ) , so the nearest i
could obtain is the hilton houston plaza ( 6633 travis ) some 3 . 5 miles away
from enron . ( if it is important that i stay at the closer hotels , shirley
might ascertain whether enron ' s travel agent can obtain a room there . )
i take this opportunity to request of shirley that , subject to your
approval , an overhead projector , screen and small lectern be made available
for the room where the 11 : 30 luncheon meeting takes place . also , since i
would like each participant to have his / her own copy , i would ask her to
advise me as to the number of participants expected to attend , or
alternatively , shirley could make copies of the presentation handout when i
bring the " master " copy in thur . morn .
i look forward to seeing you wed . and thur . best regards ,
ehud
