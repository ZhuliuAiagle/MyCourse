Subject: summer rotation in rac
vince ,
i had a lunch meeting with rudi and vladi from rac , and i also met with ted
murphy .
they are supposed to get back with me by friday to confirm the proposed
summer rotation .
so far i have a very positive impression of the group , and the projects that
they are involved in .
they also told me that rac and research people are often working on projects
together , so i am sure that my ties with research are not going to go away
with me rotating to rac .
i will keep you posted on further developments .
coordially ,
