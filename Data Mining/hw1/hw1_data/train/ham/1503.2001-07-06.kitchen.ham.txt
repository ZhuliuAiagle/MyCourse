kal , please provide david with as many statistics as he needs for his book . could you also make sure that david gets help in turning around any comments on any quotes etc he may want to use for his book as i understand they have some pretty short timescales .
i have attached a couple of recent presentations and the old presentation from the analyst conference in january .
thanks
louise
