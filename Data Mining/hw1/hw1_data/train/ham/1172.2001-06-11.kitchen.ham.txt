Subject: tractebel signed vitro
ena entered into a purchase and sale agreement today to sell 80 % of our monterrey project to tractebel . it is anticipated that it will take 60 - 90 days to get idb and cfc approval , and have targeted a mid - august closing . some of you may be aware that tractebel attempted to add a new cp at the last minute ( last monday ) . we did not accept the cp but rather crafted another solution ( thanks maria elena ) of no real value to enron but with optical value to tractebel .
i will keep you all up to date as this transaction progresses .
thanks ,
don
