before we spend any money , i ' ll pull together the market info to determine if there is enough residual value / liquidity data to support a story that the loan would be secured .

with regards to the existing deal , the setup costs and timeline was primarily the result of working out the kinks on legal / accounting structures to find a deal structure both sides could live with . i would hope costs would be lower on future additions . having said that , though , the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity . to the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value upon a quick liquidation , the put / call price protection embeds more enron risk in the financing . in the current environment , i am less than confident i could sell the unsecured enron piece shortly . jim , can you stay point on this exercise for the ercs and other items . thanks .
