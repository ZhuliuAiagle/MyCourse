vince ,
maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire an junior / full economist . she then asked me to contact johns hopkins sais to get resumes of possible candidates . i have completed all this . but , before i begin contacting these potential candidates , i wanted to confirm with you that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or associate economist level .
thank you .
