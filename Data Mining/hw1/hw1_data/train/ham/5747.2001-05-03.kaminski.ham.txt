Subject: invitations to presentation only
hi christie ,
when do you sleep ? 2 am , ugh !
ok , you were correct , my invitation was to those people within enron that the students talked with before interviewing competitors , and it was an invitation to the presentation only . i didn ' t think any of them would be invited to the dinner , and probably none will even come to the presentation . the invitation did elicit one request for the final report though , so maybe it wasn ' t a complete waste .
i didn ' t realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit . that sounds great . i wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game , that would have made the whole slumming experience better . now they ' ll get the royal treatment at enron field . it ' ll be great .
vince invited 4 people from rice :
dennis w . loughridge , director of energy consortium ; lounghrid @ rice . edu
carrie miller , director of mba program ; cmiller @ rice . edu
deborah barrett , inst . communications , barrett @ rice . edu
dr . wil uecker , associate dean for executive education , uecker @ rice . edu
loughridge wrote back saying he ' ll come , i don ' t know about the others
here are the 6 students emails :
" ritwik \ ( ronnie \ ) ghosh " , " ivy ghose " , " luigi calabrese " , " pravas sud " , " syed \ ( farhan \ ) iqbal "
your 2 from rice makes a total of 12 from rice , i guess
let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to monday
look forward to seeing you then
