Subject: confidentiality agreement
paul ,
thank you for taking the time to meet with louise and myself this past wednesday . i felt that the meeting was very informative and that discussions between enron and marathon have progressed in a constructive manner to broach a potential asset management outsourcing arrangement .
as promised during the meeting , i have attached enron ' s confidentiality / non - disclosure agreement . enron ' s appropriate legal contact for further questions or comments regarding this document would be mr . gerald nemec . he can be reached at ( 713 ) 853 - 3512 .
after the confidentiality agreement is signed , i look forward to delivering a proposal for the above mentioned commercial arrangement .
if i can be of further assistance , please do not hesitate to call . i can be reached at ( 713 ) 853 - 1931 .
regards ,
jean
