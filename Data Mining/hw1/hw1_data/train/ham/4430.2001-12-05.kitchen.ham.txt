i ' m not absolutely sure either , but i think she is saying they can provide a package that :
1 ) provides it staff that will not leave , and can backfill any attrition we may see .
2 ) provide cash for us to use as we see fit ( i . e . retention ) using our existing hardware assets as collateral .
3 ) help with any future integration work with the potential newco buyers ( apparantly she knows who they are and they use ibm also , and she has contacts there ) .
4 ) use ibm ' s name to help in anyway that may make the venture more likely to succeed .
