Subject: re : dealbench , tobias munk
ok - - level set . the tone of my message was not meant to be confrontational . i had a number of meetings with tobias to discuss his plans , which as of thursday had not panned out . i simply wanted to make sure that ross and i were getting the latest news from ena especially if you were considering using the platform in any longer - term manner , which is new information . don has been one of our biggest supporters , and i certainly want to make sure he gets some input on the direction of dealbench . i just didn ' t want it to go through tobias first .
sorry for the confusion ,
brad

sorry this is getting a bit messed up . as i said on friday , tobias came to see me to say goodbye and sated that he may consider buying dealbanch if he can raise the money ( this would obviously be great for enw ) . i told hiim we ( ena ) would be a customer of dealbench ( as we intend to continue using it next year or find another method ) . i intorduced don and tobias and said that we could give him some sort of contract if he were to pitch a dealbench buyout . . as you all know he only left friday and has had no discussions with anyone and this is purely conceptual , my guess is he gets another energy trading job in europe .
i only forwarded the note to you for information post our friday discussion to ensure you were happy with us replying and what you wanted us to say . the response to don is somewhat inappropriate as it wasn ' t tobias contacting don out of the blue but following the conversation i relayed to greg .
let us know whether you are happy for ena to agree to a contract or not should he ever buy it from you - its that simple and a really long shot . as discussed on friday , ena will not support dealbench on an allocated basis , the economics of being the only customer simply do not work . if we continue on the same charging basis with perhaps a minimum that ' s fine .
no idea how we got down this path .

has tobias shown us who is backing him and how much money he can get ? we still need to , in parallel , deal with the business units on if they will support it through an allocation processs in 2002 .
thanks .

since tobias munk is no longer an employee of enron as of last week , please direct all correspondance concerning dealbench to either me or ross mesquita . we will then contact potential purchasers or investors at the appropriate time . as you know , we are currently formulating our plans for the platform and we would appreciate any input you have to that end . if you have any questions , please feel free to give me a call . thanks in advance for your help on this .

hi don ,
the investment climate out there is very harsh , as you probably know . for me to raise vc money i need to show client business .
if you could confirm to me on a non - binding basis that enron americas is looking to continue to use dealbench datarooms and that a platform lease of a substantial value could be reached , that would help me a great deal in the process . please feel free to amend in any way you feel fit and be as specific or unspecific as you see appropriate .
please reply to my enron e - mail as well as my private e - mail
tobiasmunk @ yahoo . com
thanks very much and i will be in touch ( after the quarter and your successful divestitures : - )
