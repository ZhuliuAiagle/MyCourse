Subject: re : thursday night ' s dinner ( and friday also )
hello all :
bad news ! most of the really nice restaurants in breckenridge close on the
22 nd of april . we may have to have all the dinners at the hotel . do you
have
any other suggestions ?
i will check with scott yeager ' s wife again today to see if she perhaps knows
of another good restaurant that may be open , but the owner of pierre ' s told
me most of them close and open again for the summer season in may .
thanks !
shirley
