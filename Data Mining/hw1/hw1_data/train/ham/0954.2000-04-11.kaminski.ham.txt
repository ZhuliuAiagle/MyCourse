tim ,
i hope things are going well in resco . i think somebody from resco ( or
research ) may be interested in the email i received below from brad davids .
brad is now working at abacus who works with residential customer patterns as
well as predictive modelling . he ' s going to be here the 25 and 26 of this
month . i ' m not sure who is responsible for resco marketing , but i think they
would find this interesting . who should i send this to ? please let me know
if anybody in resco may have any interest .
thanks ,
steve
ps : vince , simply an fyi since they do focus on modelling and research .

steve :
i ' ll see if i can get in on the 25 th . . . will let you know , but i think
it ' ll work .
just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be
interested , abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying
behavior in the world ( 89 million us households , 3 billion + purchases ) ,
along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer
response to various offers at the household level . given the critical need
to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets , we believe
that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct
marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to
whatever the offer is - - improving the efficiency of mailings and other
promotional campaigns ( so there is an efficiency angle , see ! )
because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on
actual purchases , our results tend to be significantly more predictive than
demographic - based models . so far , the the response from utilities and " new
entrants " i ' ve been talking to so far has been quite positive , and we have
some tests of our data underway , but we ' re interested in talking to as many
players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet
utility needs .
i can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested , but
i guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to
arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25 th of april with whoever at enron
might have interest in hearing what we ' re up to , and ( most importantly )
listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets .
thanks very much for any help . . . i look forward to catching up and
hearing how things are going for you .
regards ,
brad davids
