keith ,
it was a great pleasure to work you with on this project .
the entire enron team was impressed by the quality of the students
and commitment of the school to exploring new and creative
ways of exposing students to business problems .

vince ;
i just wanted to tell you how much i enjoyed working with enron on the tiger
project . i found the interaction with you and your colleagues very
stimulating . the ideas we covered ( like whether there are network
externalities in these markets ) was more like a workshop than a project . i
wish all businessmen had your interests and capabilities .
thanks
keith
