david jones in east gas origination completed a transportation management transaction with yankee gas last night . this negotiation has been ongoing but the values and the structure have , until yesterday been extremely volatile . david was able to bring the client to the table yesterday and complete the deal . it is only a nov 01 - mar 02 term but should book orig of $ 400 , 000 + . this was not on the hotlist due to the uncertainty that had been surrounding its completion . yankee has worked this transaction with engage for the past several years , it is good to get one of these coming our way .
fyi
