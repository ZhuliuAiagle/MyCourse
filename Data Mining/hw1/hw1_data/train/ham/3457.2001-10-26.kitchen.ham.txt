subject : end of quarter origination numbers
q 3 now over , you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups . please could you ensure the numbers are both ;
( i ) correct , and
( ii ) correctly allocated
should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers , just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left . these numbers will be used as a ( obviously only one component ) component of performance review . as you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too . if you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from faith .
please send all alterations to faith killen or call her on 30352 .
thanks
