Subject: enron direct canada
louise , with pope ' s departure , i need to find someone to run enron direct canada . i will do it in the interim , but it needs someone full - time - driving the business . i wanted to get your thoughts re approaching dave forrester . i understand ( from pope ) that dave may have an interest in returning to calgary .
