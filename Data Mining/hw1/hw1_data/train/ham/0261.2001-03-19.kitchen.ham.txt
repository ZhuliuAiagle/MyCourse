Subject: draft press release : sale of pastoria to calpine
attached is a draft press release regarding the sale of the pastoria energy center to calpine . i have added enron to the headline and a quote from john lavorato to the original calpine release .
since the deal signed on friday and calpine is already talking about the deal publicly ( yet we didn ' t get their proposed release until now ) , please forward your comments to me as soon as possible . i would like to get back to calpine today ( monday , march 19 ) or first thing in the morning at the latest . i am in florida working on our power plants , but am online and can be reached at 888 - 809 - 7936 ( pager ) or 281 - 414 - 9669 ( cell ) .
thanks .
eric
