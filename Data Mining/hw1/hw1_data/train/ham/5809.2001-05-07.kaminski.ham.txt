trust you have had the opportunity to review the draft of the dabhol report
that was sent on 24 april 2001 . i assume that the circulation of the report
to the relevant people within dabhol and enron has been done at your end . it
will be helpful if all comments are collated and send through you . the
report can then be amended to incorporate your comments and a final version
sent for your records . we would very much to close the assignment with the
completion of the report .
please do let me know , if we can do any further analysis and sensitivities
to assist enron and dabhol in the existing phase of discussions with mseb
and the state government .
best regards
narottam
