good question . i think he has experience using other people ' s money to get asset deals done - worth asking . answer probably depends on a gut feel on how we answer the questions :
is something changing that increases the number of potential counterparties ?
is something changing that increases the number of products / risks that we can intermediate ?
if answer is yes - perhaps we just need more good mid - marketers .
if answer is no - maybe we need someone that can look at bigger regional issues - infrastructure , cross - border basis , etc .
have him based in houston and go for it for 12 months . if nothing materializes , it ' s a small investment for a large , neighboring country .
