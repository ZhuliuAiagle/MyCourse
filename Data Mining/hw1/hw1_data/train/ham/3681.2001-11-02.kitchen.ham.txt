Subject: ny event w / pec & keyspan
louise ,
it is my understanding that you have represented discomfort in signing the ny event expenditure approval form . i appreciate that a " holiday event " or spending any amount on customer entertainment seems counter to what we all are staying awake at night contemplating about our future . however , on our trip in ny we received positive feedback from keyspan ( even with the current events disclosed ) on a jv structure and the interest to leverage a midwest to northeast structure . we described that the ny event this year would be only between pec and keyspan and they immediately placed the date on their calendars . since the meeting they have each confirmed ( chuck , ed & mike ) of their attendance .
please remember $ 15 , 000 of this event is already fixed sunk cost and the incremental amount represents roughly $ 19 , 000 . i am continuing to work with dori to decrease the remaining amount .
i would appreciate your consideration of providing the approval . if not , i need to un - invite pec and keyspan asap . dori needs to act immediately to firm the numbers represented with each of the vendors .
thanx ,
laura
