calpine ' s settlement with pg and , 4 . ) on july 10 , nrg energy announced it
would acquire a 2 , 255 mw portfolio from indeck .
3 . latin america pressuring aes earnings the likelihood of downside to our
2001 eps estimate for aes . corp . of $ 1 . 89 has increased materially . we
believe the ongoing currency weakness combined with power rationing have the
potential to negatively impact 2001 eps by $ 0 . 25 - $ 0 . 30 versus prior
expectations - on a stand - alone basis . while management indicated in mid - may
that it could offset weakness in brazil , the currency has materially
depreciated since that time and shows no signs of improvement in the
near - term . aes ' s second quarter earnings conference call will take place on
july 26 . following the call , we will adjust our 2001 estimate accordingly ,
unless management indicates that it remains positioned to offset these items
through upside in other parts of its business .
4 . ferc alj issues report on thursday ( 7 / 12 ) , curtis wagner , the
administrative law judge who presided over the recent settlement conference ,
issued a report presenting his findings and recommendations for next steps .
overall , the report was very much consistent with our expectations . while
wagner notes that some refunds are due from the generators , he argues that
the $ 8 . 9 billion demanded by the state of california " cannot be
substantiated . " we believe calpine and mirant offer the greatest downside
protection from this issue .
5 . csfb power generation supply chain conference on september 10 and 11 ,
csfb will host a power generation supply chain conference at the plaza hotel
in new york city . this event is designed to provide investors with a
wholistic perspective on all aspects of the sector - from coal and natural gas
