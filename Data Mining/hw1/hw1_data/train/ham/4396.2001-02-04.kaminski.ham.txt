Subject: latest revision
vince ,
i have made bold face edits to the attached document . i still have two edits
to make but am concerned that you were not reading the most recent version .
sorry for any confusion but the editor doesn ' t use the edit function in word
so i have ended up making edits on new versions of the paper .
i still haven ' t made the change regarding the take - or - pay problem ( i left
that paper at home in my briefcase and will make the change tomorrow
morning ) . also , i haven ' t added anything regarding the conflict that arose
over pay for new hires nor have i received the business week e - mail from you .
however , if the paper looks ok to mark palmer we can make these minor edits
on the galley pages of the article .
thanks
john
