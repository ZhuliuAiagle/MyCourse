we are excited that you want to interview the comp finance students .
do you want to do it in dec . or before ? let me know what best suits you .
since there are only 16 individuals in the pittsburgh area . . . we should be
able to accomodate you . . . would you want one or two schedules . . ?
what is the formal protocol in such matters ?

all you need to do is let me know some ideal dates . . . and you send a job
description and names of the students you want to interview .
we will try to be as accomodating as possible .
