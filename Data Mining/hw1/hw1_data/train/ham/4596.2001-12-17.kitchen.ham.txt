Subject: gentlemen and lady ,
while i have enjoyed and leanred much from my experience at enron , the time has come for me to move on to new endeavors . effective end of the day on friday , december 21 , 2001 , i will be resigning from enron .
i have decided to establish an independent consultancy firm , and i would hope we can work together again in the future .
for the remainder of this week until my resignation date , i will continue to do my best to wrap - up loose ends and prepare the remaining staff of the competitive analysis business unit for possible resumption of business activities .
sincerely ,
scott s . tholan
