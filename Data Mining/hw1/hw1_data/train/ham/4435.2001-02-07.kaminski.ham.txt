michelle ,
the coding is progressing nicely . cecil and david have the first part of the
code
almost done ( there are 3 parts of code ) , and they expect to have the first
two parts
completed by next tuesday or wednesday . if ken ' s needed , that will be in the
testing of the third part of code , which should be sometime next week or
later .
i will inform you of the status change as soon as possible .
