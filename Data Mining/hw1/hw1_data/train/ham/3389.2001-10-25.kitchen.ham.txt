louise ,
i believe what you are seeing is names of enron networks employees who are placing orders on behalf of ena . when this happens these employees are responsible for obtaining prior approval for the responsible party within the cost center their are ordering for . additionally all it hardware purchases must be reviewed and approved by a technical buyer once the cost center financial approval is obtained . therefore , some of the individuals which you see listed in the approver 1 and approver 2 columns will not be ena employees .
please advise if you have any additional questions .
thanks
john
