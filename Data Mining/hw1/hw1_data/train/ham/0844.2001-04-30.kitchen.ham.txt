louise ,
don and i spoke about this prior to the execution of the highstar letter . while we both feel that it is unlikely that we will be in " material negotiations " with a potential counterparty within the next 11 days ( or so ) , we are prepared to notify aig in the event that something comes very quickly . thanks .
