Subject: fw : ubs sign - off
louise :
we are making progress , but it is slow . below are listed the contracts or terms on which we need sign off from ubs warburg . i telephoned brian murtagh today and asked him to come down this week to houston to help finalize all the forms by the end of the week . he is coming on thursday . we also talked about getting sign off from tax and credit at the same time , so as not to delay things . he is hopeful that no sign off will be required from switzerland ( re the bank netting issue ) at least on an interim basis .
in regard to the counterparties we are going to focus on first - - i need a further prioritization of the list with approximately 160 counterparties that i believe you had prepared . i think i need the top 50 , the second 50 and so on .
i will be out on wednesday , thursday and friday for my operations .
regards ,
mark haedicke
