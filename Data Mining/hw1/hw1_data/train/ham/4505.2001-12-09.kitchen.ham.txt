piper is incorrect in the sense there is no decision on who owns the code or licence yet .
eol is not for sale today .

talk with richter and louise together if possible . initially newco would only get an exclusive license for gas and power and not the code but i think creditors should have options so brad is still looking at determining eol value outside of a newco deal .
