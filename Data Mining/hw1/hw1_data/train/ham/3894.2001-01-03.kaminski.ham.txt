Subject: the garp convention
dear shirley
?
further to our telephone conversation earlier today , i am writing concerning
the garp 2001 convention , which will be held in new york between 13 th and
14 th february .
?
i have set a new deadline for presentations to be sent to me , which is
friday 5 th january . i am sure you can appreciate that collating , arranging ,
organising and printing over 80 presentations is a mammoth logistical task ,
hence why i require the presentations as soon as possible .
?
can i please have an indication of when i am likely to receive vince ' s
presentation ? below is the talk he has agreed to give ( he has also agreed to
chair the stream on energy & corporate risk on tuesday 13 th february ) :
?
measuring energy risk - tackling price volatility , adapting var , scenario
modeling and regulatory requirements
- mean ( or floor ) reversion
