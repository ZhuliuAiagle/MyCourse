belowconse nsus estimates ; reducing target price
>
good morning ,
attached , please find our fc note on reliant resources .
summary :
1 . on september 27 , 2001 , rri announced it would acquire orion power
for $ 26 . 80 in an all - cash transaction .
? 2 . in our view this deal has very positive implications for
the sector . the purchase price is essentially in - line with our estimate of
the private market value of orn ' s asset portfolio ( $ 26 . 83 ) . overall , the
deal gives us addition confidence in our valuation framework and reinforces
our view that valuations in the sector are extremely attractive .
? 3 . rri is leaving unchanged its 2002 eps guidance of
$ 2 . 05 - $ 2 . 15 . in doing so , rri noted that the earnings contribution from
this deal ( + $ 0 . 30 ) will offset the negative impact of sluggish conditions in
the western power markets .
? 4 . our 2001 and 2002 eps estimates remain unchanged at $ 1 . 62
and $ 1 . 95 . our 2002 estimate continues to be below company guidance , giving
us comfort in our forecast .
? 5 . importantly , for 2002 rri ' s western generation assets are
currently less than 50 % hedged , which is well below the company ' s peers
including cpn ( strong buy , $ 19 . 75 ) and mir ( buy , $ 19 . 60 ) . as such , the
company is relatively more exposed to commodity price volatility in that
region of the country .
6 . we are reducing our target price to $ 30 from $ 40 . we derive this
valuation from our discounted cash flow ( dcf ) analysis , which employs an
11 . 4 % discount rate . our revised target price reflects : 1 . the $ 2 . 9 billion
acquisition expenditure ; 2 . the $ 1 . 8 billion of assumed net debt ; 3 . the
incremental earnings and synergies associated with the deal ; and , 4 . the
earnings shortfall at rri ' s western operations and slower overall growth
prospects for the business .
regards ,
