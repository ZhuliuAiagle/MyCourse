subject : ipp update : analysis of power market conditions
indicatesselling was overdone ; focus on cpn and mir
good morning ,
attached , please find our latest update on the ipp sector , which includes an
analysis of recent power market conditions
>
1 . focus on cpn and mir on july 24 , 2001 , our ipp composite traded off 8 % ,
owing to heightened market concerns surrounding " soft " spot and forward
power prices . we believe the weakness presents a buying opportunity across
the whole section and recommend that investors focus on our top 2 picks :
calpine ( cpn , strong buy ) and mirant ( mir , buy ) .
2 . power market analysis in this note we include an analysis of recent
power market conditions . we conclude that power market conditions have been
more stable than is generally believed . further , if conditions had
worsened , the earnings impact would not be severe . on that basis we believe
the sell - off across the sector was overdone .
3 . beware of national power indices ! in order to properly analyze recent
power price fluctuations , it is key to analyze the california market
separately . outside of california , spark spreads have actually increased by
2 . 7 % on average since may in a number of key markets . within california ,
there have been large declines in pricing and margins . however , potential
returns on capital in that market remain well above anywhere else in the
country .
4 . ipps are not call options on power prices ! the bulk of the group has
contracted substantial portions of their output . in particular , calpine has
sold forward 90 % of its output in 2001 and 80 % in 2002
5 . current valuations reflect the investor uncertainties 2001 and 2002 p / e
multiples have compressed by more than 40 % year to date
6 . buy on weakness to the extent earnings prospects remain intact , we view
the recent weakness as irrational .
regards ,
