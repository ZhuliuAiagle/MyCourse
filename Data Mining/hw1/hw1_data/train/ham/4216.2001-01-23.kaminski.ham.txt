Subject: merit and equity increases
norma ,
i am sending you an excel spreadsheet with proposed
merit and equity increases .
i have slightly exceeded the merit quota .
the equity increases address two issues : retention and
and an error in setting a salary at hiring ( i tend to be too stingy ) .
please , let me know if there are any questions .
i am forwarding a copy of the spreadsheet to my home address
so i can work on it tonight , if necessary .
