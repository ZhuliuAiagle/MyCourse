Subject: re : sharad update
hi kate ,
firstly it was very useful to hold the informal discussion with him . sharad
seemed hesitant due to the offer not being what he expected . he asked me
some questions about the " bonus culture " at enron and suggested that it was
not as good as at investment banks that he is interviewing with . i sold him
on the value he can extract from the excellence within the research group and
the ability to join a growing organisation at a critical point in , but he
still seemed reticent saying that he " needs time " which i understood to mean
that he was looking for a better offer elsewhere . he is a great candidate
and it would be a real shame to lose him , given the difficulty of getting
good candidates .
i discussed this with vince and given how much we need him in research in
london and vince agreed to discuss the possibility of an element of guarantee
or sign on to help him make the right decision .
i think vince will call you or dale to discuss this .
regards ,
