mexico ' s slowing economy affects power generation growth
electricity production growth rates in mexico have slowed dramatically from
2000 levels as mexico ' s economy slows in line with that of the united states .
natural gas consumption by the power sector continues to grow at over 15
percent annually , however , as new combined - cycle power plants enter service .
many new capacity projects are also delayed , keeping the market tight through
the summer . mexico ' s longer - term power supply and demand balance will depend on
* successful completion of the pending power sector reform process
* sufficient new capacity through the independent power producer program to
bridge the transition from the current structure to a competitive market
* * end * *
