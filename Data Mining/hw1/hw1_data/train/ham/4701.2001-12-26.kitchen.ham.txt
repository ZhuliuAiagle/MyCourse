the meeting has been confirmed .
they told me that they want to essentially gain an understanding of what our plan is to get up and running as quickly as possible which does i think differ slightly from integration .
have i missed any critical group ?

one of our potential buyers will be here at 9 am on thursday . the scope of the meeting is to run through the integration schedule . this is a very broad agenda and will probably be very interactive . i tried to put ops first but it really doesn ' t make sense .
this really is a really rough agenda for you guys to decide upon but i wanted to set out the areas they wish to cover .
