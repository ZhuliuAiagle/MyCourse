Subject: london exotica library migration

- exotic library :
issue : the london version is different from the houston version .
the problem is that some bugs in the london version were found .
temporary solution : bugs were immediately fixed at a local level .
permanent solution : the london exotic version will be replaced by the
houston exotic version .
the houston version is expected to be robust .
sharad ( london research ) is spending this coming week in houston .
when sharad is back to london , the houston version will replace the london
version .
approach : steven leppard is designing a regression testing procedure that
will involve it to fully test the similarity of the two versions .
the procedure is expected to take at least one month from commencement .
hopefully , no discrepancies will be found .
in the adverse case it happens , it will be necessary to conduct an analysis
to decide what is wrong .
if necessary further testing and development has to take place .
