Subject: counterparty statements
once we have the recommitment from dynegy and / or the bank debt restructured , steve kean and mark palmer would like to have some counterparties identified who would be willing to step up to the plate and reconfirm their willingness to trade with enron or state that they have come back online . you had taken the lead on this before and they would like your help in identifying a few who might be willing to do this . please advise .
