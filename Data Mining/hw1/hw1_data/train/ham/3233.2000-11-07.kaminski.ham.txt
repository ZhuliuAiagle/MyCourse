Subject: re : recruiting
good afternoon . packing emails - - its just my style : )
currently , it is my understanding that we would like to interview the comp .
fin . students during the same period that we interview the mba ' s .
tentatively speaking , one schedule should be sufficient . i will attempt to
produce an official job description shortly .
kristen is out of town for the remainder of the week , so her response to any
inquiries may be delayed . her contact info : kristin . gandy @ enron . com 713
345 3214
regarding the satellite program , vince is interested in the ecommerce
program . we think that it would be easier to keep the program full as
compared to the comp . fin . program .
it was a pleasure to be back in pittsburgh and i enjoyed meeting all the
students from this year ' s comp . fin . class . i look forward to seeing you in
a few weeks .

we are excited that you want to interview the comp finance students .
do you want to do it in dec . or before ? let me know what best suits you .
since there are only 16 individuals in the pittsburgh area . . . we should be
able to accomodate you . . . would you want one or two schedules . . ?
what is the formal protocol in such matters ?

all you need to do is let me know some ideal dates . . . and you send a job
description and names of the students you want to interview .
we will try to be as accomodating as possible .
