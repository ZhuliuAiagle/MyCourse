Subject: re : joint probabilities
bob -
i ' ve edited our numbers a bit on the azurix analysis and would like you to
re - run the joint probabilities tables .
please note that i ' ve got 2 cases in the model now - an optimistic case and a
pessimistic case . i hope you can run both cases . ( you will need to toggle
for case 1 or 2 - real complicated stuff ! ! )
please keep everything else the same ( ie , the currency probabilities , rab
probabilities , etc . )
thanks for your help .
