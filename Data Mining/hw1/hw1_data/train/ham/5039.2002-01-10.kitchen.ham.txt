i ' ve attached a marked up version of your faq ' s . i suggest we use this as a starting point for initial customer contact as soon as the buyer is known . one of the power marketers will make the initial contact , but i suggest that you have one of the eol marketers in on the conversation .
the attachment is meant as talking points for the marketer to use during the initial conversation . i understand that you are scheduling a meeting tomorrow to discuss the eol timeline / process . i suggest we try to come up with answers to each these questions during that meeting .
