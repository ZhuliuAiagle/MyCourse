subject : ews weekly report of outstanding reviews and ni / issues employees
the stats for this week are attached .
we have made some improvement over last week ' s totals by decreasing the number of outstanding reviews from 802 to 591 . the greatest improvement was in esa . however , with time running out on the 3 / 31 / 01 deadline , we are still considerably short of attaining 100 % of the reviews returned to hr . the following are the counts of reviews still outstanding : enw 99 or 9 % , eim 18 or 16 % , calme 29 or 20 % , esa 52 or 22 % , ena 253 or 23 % , egm 87 or 25 % , apachi 53 or 41 % .
over the last week elisa tamez and i have contacting many of you to offer assistance in calling delinquent supervisors . please let us know if we can provide any further assistance . as well please continue to provide input of employees that should not be considered in the reporting , i . e . ( voluntary terminations , employees on fmla , special circumstances in international regions , etc . )
