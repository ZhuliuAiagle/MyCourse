scott ,
it is my understanding that you will be taking the mariner / burlington pluto transaction into your portfolio in the 3 qol . i am available next week to train the appropriate person in your group on the deal background , current status , deal valuation , accounting , etc .
please advise .
thanks ,
lisa a . druzbik
