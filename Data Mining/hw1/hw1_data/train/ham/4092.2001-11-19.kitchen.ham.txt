Subject: re : do you want to add alvarez ?
i spoke to steffes this afternoon . i don ' t know what the ferc workload looks like . he can answer that better than me . we will need good representation at ferc during the next 12 months due to the california refund case at a minimum . steffes recommended keeping alvarez . i ' m not sure that i need him 100 percent of the time . but i am willing to go with jim ' s recommendation .
