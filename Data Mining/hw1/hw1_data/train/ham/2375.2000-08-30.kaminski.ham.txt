Subject: lng meeting
vince ,
before i contact the london staff about next wednesday ' s meeting , i was
wondering if we could move it up a little bit . the reason is that by 2 pm in
houston it is 8 pm in london and i thought it might be difficult to round up
the crew in london at that time . please let me know if we have plans to
change the time .
thanks ,
eric
