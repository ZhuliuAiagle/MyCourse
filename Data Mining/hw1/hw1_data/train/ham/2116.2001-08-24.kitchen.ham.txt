louise ,
i am doing much better now . most of pain and sour is gone . maybe it is the effect of the medication i have taken . but , i feel a lot better . next thursday , i will have a checkup on my leg . hopefully , my ruptured bone will recover soon . i am planning to come back the week after labor day .
thanks
zhiyong
