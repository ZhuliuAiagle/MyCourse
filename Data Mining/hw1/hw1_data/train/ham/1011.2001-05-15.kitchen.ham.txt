Subject: tax analysis of california assembly bill no . 128
attached is the ews tax group ' s analysis of the california assembly ' s current version of the proposed excise tax on " excess gross receipts " payable to electricity marketers selling power into california . suffice it to say that it is a poorly thought out proposal . i am working with the ews legal department and legislative affairs group to provide them the tax group ' s assessment of matters and will keep you apprised as things progress ( or , hopefully , not ) . as of today , assembly bill no . 128 is in committee and has not yet been passed by the assembly ( the bill that has been discussed as having been passed is senate bill no . 1 , which bill is inconsistent with assembly bill no . 128 and , therefore , will have to be reconciled with it at some later point ) . i will forward under cover of separate e - mail our analysis of senate bill no . 1 . best regards . shd .
