we just wanted to drop you a quick line to thank you for the invitation to
the uk met presentation today ! tony and i are currently trying to get a
grasp of what the traders here require in the way of weather information and
are building a support structure for them . as such - we will need to have
close ties with the uk met office as well as other data providers . the
information presented today was very helpful .
we ' d like to take a little time to sit down with you - and / or some of the
other participants whose markets are weather driven . we ' d like to get a feel
for what data is already streaming in - and then get an idea as to how we can
utilize and supplement that data for the europe markets . we have a model
created in houston to start from - but we want to make sure to tailor to the
needs of the traders here .
would you like to take some time to sit down and chat ? perhaps tony and i
can take you and some others out to lunch - or for an afternoon coffee ?
thanks for your help . . .
