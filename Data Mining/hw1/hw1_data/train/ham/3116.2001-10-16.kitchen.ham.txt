it was great seeing you again . sorry we weren ' t able to catch up in chicago .

i ' ll be working in enron freight markets . the learning curve is pretty vertical for now , but it ' s a great opportunity for me .
got any time to get together in the near future ? i ' d love to catch up and hear what you are up to . . . might even have to steal some of your great ideas and use them in freight . i ' m here through thursday .
