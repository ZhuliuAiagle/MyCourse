Subject: re : primary curves missing from factor loading
tanya ,
we are very close to generating factors for all primary curves . jin almost
get it done .
but we are still waiting on the expiration dates for those london curves . if
anyone can help , please help .
also , we have some curves that don ' t have futures . how to decide these
curves ' s expiration dates ?
matthew adams helped us deciding many curves expiration rules . but there are
still many primary curves that don ' t have expiration dates .
if no expiration dates , then there will be no factor loadings . whoever wants
to generate factor loadings then give us the expiration dates first ! : )

bjorn ,
you are absolutely right that we should run the factors for every primary
curve .
it has been working for a while on this .
the problem is data , as always ( missing price curves , zero prices , not
changing prices , etc . )
most of these problems come from london curves , so winston and jin yu are
debugging the code ,
fixing the problems for every curve .
winston ,
do you think we are ready to calculate factors for us curves ? ( while continue
working on the rest ) .

tanya , naveen :
i am confused , i thought that when we identified primary curves they would
then have factors run against them . does this not distort what we are trying
to do with the primary and var ?

i am in the same situation as manfred . i have one primary curve for southern
cone gas and one for southern cone power and i am not getting factors for
either . for my power curves i am getting wti factors and for gas i am
getting ng factors .
but i do agree with you manfred , i think all the primary curves should have
their own factor loadings .

christian ,
at least you have 2 curves that you get factors for . i get none . i have
four primary curves for coal but factors from nbsk are used . in emissions i
have one primary curve but wti factors are used . i think all the primary
curves should have their own factor loadings . xochitl , what factors are used
for your primary curves ?

i was in the process of setting up sunil ' s template for calculating
co - variance on all liquids primary curves using the " factor loading " data .
unfortunately , i did not get very far , because i noticed that the factor
loading table contains only 2 ( wti & hu ) out of 13 liquids primary curves . i
am concern that liquids var could conceivably be over or understated due to
the absence of 11 other curves which are listed below . please verify your
perspective commodity desk on this issue .
