Subject: follow - up on captive generation
vince / stinson ,
please find below two attachemnts . the excell spreadsheet shows some
calculations on the savings from using dabhol power as against a diesel
genset operating at a higher heat rate . there is also a differential in
price of diesel , as against naphtha used by the plant . i have taken data
from the septemeber bill of dpc . we do not want to give the actual numbers
to the press , since they ar likely to have a field day with the 6 cent / kwh
energy price of dabhol that is reflected there .
the seond attachement ( word ) has the wordings that i think we can send in to
the press . please review the calculations and the note , ad if you find this
satisfactory , please forward to jeff / s .
i am availabel on mobile if you have questions o clarifications . the number
( 610 mw ) for total captive generation in maharashtra ) is taken from mohan
gurunath ' s presentation on this .
regards ,
sandeep .
