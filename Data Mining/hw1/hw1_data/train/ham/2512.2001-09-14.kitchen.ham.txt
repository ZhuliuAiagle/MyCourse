louise ,
i have worked with sunjay to revise the presentation to reflect the changes made last time as well as to include some new candidates represented from our london office . the breakout of meritocracy candidates is as follows :
8 commercial women ( does not include you , but currently includes myself - having a personal debate over being a poster child )
6 commercial support women
10 commercial males - including more representation from london office
6 commercial support men
sunjay is going to contact the london office ( but not use his hr channels - i have recommended that he call marcello ) to identify more international meritocratic candidiates that are women . assuming he identifies three women , i can drop myself as a meritocratic candidate . : )
sunjay understands that we are trying to identify a portfolio of candidates that represent a balance . as such , he will continue to target other employees to further represent commercial support and specialized technical .
please delete individuals as appropriate from attached presentation and forward back to sunjay , with myself cc ' d .
regards , mrha
