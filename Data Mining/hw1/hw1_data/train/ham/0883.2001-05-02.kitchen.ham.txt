louise ,
if you think the message was weird , let me tell you about the conversation . . . launch a public campaign against the mayor of portland , the port of portland , align ourselves with the pro - salmon environmentalists , pass legislation , and if we are lucky we get 800 prime acres for residential development ! don ' t expect to see it on the hotlist .
cheers ,
chris
