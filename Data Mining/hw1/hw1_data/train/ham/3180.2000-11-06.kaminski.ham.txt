subject : amitava ' s visit
really appreciate your freeing amitava up to provide critical input into the
quantitative work we have undertaken . as you are aware much of the work
requires exploring uncharted territory and the team has confirmed the
significant contribution that amitava ' s experience and expertise has provided
in a very short timeframe .
as you might expect , this quickly confirms that we really need more dedicated
support from someone with amitava ' s background . it is imperative that we
leverage his experience to speed up the process and apply critical insights
into our project . this will not only speed up the work considerably but also
ensure that we have put our best team on the difficult issues in front of us .
i would like to discuss an arrangement where we can ensure amitava is more
integrated into our efforts . i realize it will be difficult to free him up
but maybe we can put something together which works for everybody .
some early ideas :
have amitava and family come over for 6 weeks of dedicated support . this
should allow us to develop the communication processes to run a global quant
effort for the project and then continue with amitava a full time ec . com
resource working from houston . this is likely my preference .
or
agree a schedule of regular trips which allows amitava to provide critical
insights and oversight of the project and give our team a resource to extract
his experience on an ongoing basis .
let ' s discuss before i talk to john about the practicalities
thanks for your assistance .
