ian ,
sorry for a delay in getting back to you .
i have one challenge i did not anticipate
when i talked to you the first time about our real options
internal seminar .
the materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school , and there is some sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the materials
outside enron .
please , give me some time to find out if i can work
around this issue .
