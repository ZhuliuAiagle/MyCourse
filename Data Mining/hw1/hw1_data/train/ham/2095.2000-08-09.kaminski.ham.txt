Subject: matlab at enron
hello vince :
i ' m the territory manager for the mathworks , we develop matlab technical
software . we ' ve recently developed tools well suited for energy trading
industry .
enron has used our products in the past , but all of those end - users have
left enron .
risk management and research groups at southern energy , txu , dynegy , el
paso energy , koch , calpine , reliant and others have recently started using
our products in the following ways .
1 . create sophisticated option pricing models , risk analysis models , and
stress analysis models . creating gui front ends for the end - users .
2 . pull in data from odbc , corba , and sas databases to evaluate .
3 . visualize the results and quantify the solution .
4 . compile these models and distribute these applications to their
traders , analysists and managers with no distribution costs .
who should i contact at your company to discuss enron ' s situation to see if
our can help enron as it has with our other energy customers ?
thank you for your time and help .
