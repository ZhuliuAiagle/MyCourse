louise ,
i want to ask you for 15 minutes of your time to talk to you about career opportunities with the mexico group . i understand that this is a tough time but i believe that that my experience and career can be useful to help in the developing of business in mexico .
i worked for almost 10 year in mergers & acquisition and investment banking in mexico before joining enron ' s mergers & acquisition and finance origination group headed by frank stabler in the former ei / calme . currently , i am a manager at the enron xcelerator group leading a business development project in the transportation industry . however , given the current environment at enron , the project will unlikely be funded .
i am attaching my resume for your review and i would like to ask you for 15 minutes of your time to discuss about a potential career opportunities in your group .
thanks .
