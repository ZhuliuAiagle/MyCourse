subject : garp 2001 convention
dear garp 2001 speaker
?
this is just a quick note to keep you up - to - date with developments at the
garp 2001 convention , which will be held in new york between 12 th and 15 th
february , 2001 .
?
thus far , garp 2001 looks set to far exceed our expectations and garp 2000 .
there has been a great deal of interest in the 2001 convention . delegate
bookings have been much higher than this time last year . as a result , we are
set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention earlier this year .
the three workshops and the one - day asset management forum are also very
well received and will probably reach full capacity . i will of course
provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the event .
?
regarding the event itself , i would like a few outstanding issues :
?
1 . presentations : can you please e - mail your presentation to me by 15 th
december , so that i have enough time to reproduce them and place them in a
delegate pack for the convention . ( given the break of the christmas and new
york period , and that the event is being held in new york , i am sure you can
appreciate that there are certain logistical factors that need to be taken
into account , hence the reason why the presentations are required as soon as
possible ) . this is purely for reproduction , we also request you bring your
presentation to the convention on the day in either a floppy disc or a
laptop .
?
2 . audio - visual requirements : can you please inform me of what audio - visual
requirements you may have ( 35 mm slides ; ohp ; lcd projection - notably
powerpoint ) .
?
3 . check list : i have attached a check list for your information . if you
have not returned this already , can you please read and fax it to my
colleague , claire as soon as possible .
?
if you have any questions or queries , please do not hesitate to contact me ,
otherwise i eagerly await your response in due course .
?
i look forward to seeing you in new york in february .
?
kind regards
?
andreas
