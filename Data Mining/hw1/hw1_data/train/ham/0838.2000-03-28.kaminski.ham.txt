Subject: an apology
kevin -
i need to apologize to you for speaking out - of - turn yesterday about
work - in - progress . any model our group has of the natural gas system remains
completely untested and unvalidated . i have not been asked by any one of my
superiors , vasant or wince , to give advice to anyone at enron concerning
natural gas ; i am not an expert in trading natural gas . my work exists within
a large and professional group , and , to the point , vince alone will decide
when , and if , any gas model is suitable for dissemination within enron .
sincerely ,
clayton vernon
manager , research
