Subject: fyi : sycamore support on network planning
fyi :
note that the person mentioned in the text below ( ming lung lee ) is very
experienced in traditional traffic engineering work . he comes from mci where
he was responsible for modeling traffic etc . it appears that sycamore
finally got him . one time they had lost him to corvis ( another optical
equipment company ) , i guess sycamore went back to him with a better deal ! as
soon as this guy is available , i ' ll set up an all day technical meeting to
hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development
is concerned . i want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly
outline what needs to be done to support dynamic , optical - switched - circuits
based trading and streaming media applications , etc . having such an industry
expert help us will help ' justify ' internally all the the effort on the
traffic analysis side that john griebling has asked us to support . keep in
mind that even though he is an expert in the field , the field that we need to
play in has not develop yet . even the emerging data based traffic ( as opposed
to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed ) analysis is an order of
magnitude more difficult ( due to uncertain load ) , let alone trading such load
( which we are planning to do ! ) .
ravi .
. . . sycamore hired a guy per griebling ' s request , to work with you on the
design / planning piece of the business . he will be contracted out to enron
for a period of 6 months initially . he lives in sf but will be traveling to
whereever you need him . jim , griebling wanted us to set up a meeting
between you guys for wednesday morning , if you have time . his name is ming
lung lee and he comes to us from mci . let me know what works .

hi ravi . fair enough , we will make sure we keep you guys in the loop . let
barb / me know which items we can offload to you guys .
first thing to be done is barb will schedule a call between us and you all
to gain a better understanding of a number we are trying to back into with
the metro solutions ( there are alot of options on our side and we need some
guidelines ) . i already talked to john about this this morning so we need to
make some headway on that number . also , we are scheduled for a conference
call wednesday morning with griebling to discuss where we are at with
initial solutions for metro . would you like to join us ?
thursday night , we have a dinner tentatively planned ( talk with griebling
about who , where , etc . ) . friday we will be meeting all day at the omni in
interlocken .
ravi and jim , per my conversations with john , he is going to run point on
the metro solutions . dorn is swamped with other activities . as for the
switching piece , we discussed our routing software on monday and i think
that is all we are going to do until ahi is done then we will set up a
meeting between our guys and the ahi folks . the expectation is that this
meeting will occur in the next 30 days .
also , sycamore hired a guy per griebling ' s request , to work with you on the
design / planning piece of the business . he will be contracted out to enron
for a period of 6 months initially . he lives in sf but will be traveling to
whereever you need him . jim , griebling wanted us to set up a meeting
between you guys for wednesday morning , if you have time . his name is ming
lung lee and he comes to us from mci . let me know what works .
the best ways to reach me are my cell phone or text pager . cell is
303 - 619 - 2485 and pager is 888 - 467 - 6167 - - you can send me a text message
from either your pager ( if you have a 2 way ) or press 3 to get an operator .
thanks , kristin
