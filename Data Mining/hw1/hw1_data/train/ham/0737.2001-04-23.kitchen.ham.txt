Subject: abb meeting
louise :
you requested that i give you a list of things to avoid discussion with abb . we ' ve maintained a reasonably open relationship with abb up to this point , but here are some ( fairly obvious ) things that we should probably steer clear of :
1 . no discussion about fronterra ;
2 . no specifics about the deacero contract , e . g . extension date , cp ' s , etc ; and
3 . no discussion about project credit issues or financing alternatives for the project .
when this abb contingent was here last ( feb 2001 ) , dave and janet essentially indicated that this was an important project to enron , that we were entirely committed to seeing it through and that if it weren ' t for the damn cfe , we ' d already be done , etc . etc . i think if we stick to that line , we ' ll be fine .
if i think of anything else , i ' ll let you know asap .
