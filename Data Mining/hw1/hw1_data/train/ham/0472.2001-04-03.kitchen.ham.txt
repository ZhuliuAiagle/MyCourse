i am repsonsible for middle market coverage for west power in portland . we spoke a week or so ago re : the ena / ees customer split methodology . i will be in houston next monday and tuesday ( april 9 / 10 ) . i would like to spend a half hour or so with you , if you had time , to brief you on what ' s going in the middle market group in portland , reviewing year to date earnings and a market share analysis we recently completed . you may be getting some info . from tim and / or internal reports , but i figured , since i was going to be in houston , it would be a good chance to fill in some details .
i had asked john lavorato if he wanted to meet , but he indicated ( see below ) that it would be more appropriate to meet with you . tim b . also indicated i should try to meet you as well . let me know if you would like to meet and what time works for you .
thanks !
chris
