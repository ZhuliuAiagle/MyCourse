Subject: p . v . krishnarao ' s expenses
good afternoon sandeep :
i sent krishna ' s expenses for his recent trip to our accounting dept . this
morning and expensed them to the research group ' s co and rc # .
however , we need to be reimbursed for these expenses and i would like
to know the best way to do this . our accounting dept . thought we should
just send an invoice with the back up material to dabhol power co . asking
them to cut a check made payable to enron corp . and then it would be
credited to our co # and rc # .
please let me know if this is acceptable , and if so , who the invoice should
be made out to and where i should send it .
i appreciate your assistance in this matter .
have a great day !
