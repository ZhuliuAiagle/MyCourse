subject : re : mission impossible - hr associate groups recommendation and next
steps
i notice my calender doesn ' t yet seem to have this meeting scheduled . i will
ask kay chapman ( since rhonna has now deserted me ! ) to help put a time
together . drew / mary , fyi sorry i didn ' t get a chance to send you this before .
let me know if you want to attend , happy to have you there .
gerry , can you help me put an agenda together so that everyone knows what we
are looking to achieve here . in broad terms i am looking to do the following :
update all on project we set hr associate group and their recommendations
discuss their recommendations and look at any refinements or ideas we think
we should also incorporate ( see my thumb nail sketch notes inspired by
associate group below ) .
reaffirm commitment to take this project forward and agree :
team for doing so
resources and timimg
methodology for agreeing final version .
my ambition is that we ( but in particular andrea , bob , gerry , tim , tana , dan ,
neil , myself and possibly suzanne if she can given the work she had already
done in this area ) all agree to contribute to this and get it done without
the need for a formation of a new team or group . obviously everyone welcome
to participate .
tana / dan ,
can you cicruclate a summary of your teams proposals to this group so we they
can review before meeting . could you also agree within your team who you
would like to attend this meeting ( i would suggest 2 or 3 of you attend
rather than all ) .
thanks
david

steps
rhonna ,
please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this
message ( vince , it would great if one of your team could attend since we will
need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project ) .
the prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps
required to implement the hr associate groups recommendations for the
development of an hr " value index " at enron .
i would anticipate we will need approx 45 minutes .
