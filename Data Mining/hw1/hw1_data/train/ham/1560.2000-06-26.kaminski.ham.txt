rep is not representing only those individuals who may work in his or her
specific opco but individuals that work throughout the organization . the prc
rep will continue to represent the assigned associates or analysts during
their entire tenure with the program .
the prc reps are expected to contact the prc supervisor and gather
performance information ( including pre - ratings if available ) .
the program will prepare a binder for each prc rep that includes consolidated
feedback from the pep system for their assigned associates or analysts and
will provide this to the prc representatives on july 7 th .
associates and analysts will be pre - rated by their business unit supervisor
using the six performance ratings ( superior - issues ) and the management
professional feedback form as detailed in the pep system . the pre - ratings
must be loaded into pep by july 6 th .
the associate and analyst ratings will be cross - calibrated by tenure at the
meeting as follows :
associates :
level 1 : 0 to 6 months
level 2 : 7 to 12 months
levels 3 & 4 will be reviewed together : 13 months + .
analysts :
level 1 : 0 to 6 months
level 2 : 7 to 12 months

cannot be changed once the meeting has ended .
following the global associate and analyst prc , the associates  , and the
analysts  , supervisors will obtain the final rating from the prc
representative . the supervisors must ensure that an evaluation session is
conducted and the final rating is communicated to each associate and analyst
