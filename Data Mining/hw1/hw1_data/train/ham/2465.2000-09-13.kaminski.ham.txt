toni ,
i spoke with ben this morning and he is asking me what he should do . he
knows how good the opportunity is
and this is something he really wants to do . however , his wife is having a
hard time making the commitment . although he says she is not totally against
it , she is obviously not 100 % sold . ben feels bad about keeping vince ,
grant , and other potential team members at enron waiting . he does not want
to lose the opportunity , yet he needs some help in convincing his wife . i am
open for suggestions . is this somebody you really want and if so what can
we do get him ?
thanks ,
mike
