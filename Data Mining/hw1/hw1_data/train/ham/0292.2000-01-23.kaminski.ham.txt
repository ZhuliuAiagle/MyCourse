dear dr . kaminski ,
it has been a long time since i contacted you so i was wondering if
my resume had been considered for an internship in your group .
i will appreciate it very much if you let me know when i should expect
to learn about a decision on the issue .
thank you for you time .
sincerely ,
konstantin .
