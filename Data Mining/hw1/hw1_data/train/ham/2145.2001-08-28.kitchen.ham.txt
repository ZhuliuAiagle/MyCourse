Subject: re : are we insured for the $ 1 . 1 mm new albany ?
we have a $ 1 mm deductible . we also have bi that will kick - in after 30 days ( won ' t help much ) . stuart spoke to jody and wes , and they are looking for the right home for the charge . but to answer your question , yes , it will hit income ( the joys of owning and running an asset ) ! kevin has basically told the hourly desk , no more running .
