hi rahil ,
i ' m attaching two enrononline cases that were put into our system couple of
weeks ago .
the second , short case , is a classroom handout that summarizes eol ' s
success and signals new challenges .
just fyi - - we are now developing a multimedia eol case , which will be
released on cd rom . it will have links to video interviews with jeff , ken
and louise .
we are very happy with our enron cases ; they will most likely become
bestsellers . it was a great learning experience for me and prof . bartlett ,
and you were a big part of that experience . thank you so much for all your
help ! please feel free to call me if you have any questions or need
anything else .
regards ,
