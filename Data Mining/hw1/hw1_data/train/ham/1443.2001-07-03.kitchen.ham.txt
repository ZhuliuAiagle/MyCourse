southern cone power report : brazilian crisis deepens but voluntary
conservation is strong - - for now
on june 1 , brazil implemented the first phase of a voluntary rationing plan ,
including consumption quotas for each consumer class , in an effort to avoid
rolling blackouts later in the year . demand grew strongly in the first months
of the year , but recent evidence suggests that the voluntary conservation
scheme was largely successful in june . thermal generation has also increased
significantly , but new thermal power plants will not be online until after the
next rainy season begins .
* southeast hydro reservoirs fell to 28 . 6 percent of maximum by june 26 , while
northeast reservoir levels were just 24 . 9 percent of maximum .
* conservation will have to be deep and sustained for many months to achieve
the needed demand reduction .
* government initiatives to promote new generation capacity may have serious
long - term implications for the development of a competitive power
market .
* * end * *
