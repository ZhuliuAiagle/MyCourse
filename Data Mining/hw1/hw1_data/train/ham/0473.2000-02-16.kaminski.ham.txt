Subject: re : tanya vacation
vince ,
i just found out that none of my vacation days from the last year is in the
computer system
( it says that i have 0 c / over days ) .
it was november 3 , 1999 when i asked your approval to carry over 12 vacation
days to the next year .
i was thinking that if you ( or hr ) do not approve i could at least take these
days in 1999 .
i know that your tried to help me and sent to brad mcsherry the
justification for me to carry over 10 days .
i bothered you a few times in november and december 1999 and since your
response was optimistic
i did not take any of those 10 days in 1999 . but i never heard from hr .
now i am not sure - may be these days are not in the system by mistake .
i would like to take 5 of them in march ( from 3 / 13 / 00 to 3 / 17 / 00 ) .
what is your advice ? should i contact brad mcsherry ? even negative response
from hr in november or
december last year would be better than loosing vacation days .
i really appreciate your help ,
tanya .

hi , vince ,
sorry to bother again with my question .
i first e - mailed my question a month ago ( on nov . 3 ) .
since we still have not heard from hr , is it fair to assume that i can carry
over my 10 vacation days to the next year ?
if not - i have to take 5 days before dec . 17 , because then i go on vacations
anyhow . i would really prefer not to take off
most of december , there are quite a lot of things going on .
thank you for your help in resolving this question .
tanya .
