dear lance ,
the university is predicting a shortfall due to increased
gas costs of between $ 30 and $ 40 million , over the next 1 to 2
years . for a long time , i have been wanting to explore opportunities for
the
campus to sell energy to austin energy when its load is below
peak . this big shortfall provides an impetus for the university
to want to maximize the value of its plant .
