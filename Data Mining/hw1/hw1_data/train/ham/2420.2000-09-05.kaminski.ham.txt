both ,
thanks for your comments and comparisons , it is good to get context .
based on your comments here would be my proposal
o 63 , 500 basic salary -
ol 5 k kickers for each of the 2 years - these are paid as a lump sum on each
anniversary guaranteed . therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o 78 , 500 -
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
increase the value of options to o 60 k to vest 1 / 3 as before - which leaves a
1 / 3 ( $ 20 , 000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract .
just fyi - anjam is currently on o 68 , 000 but does not have an agreement , so
this would effectively put a 10 . 5 k gap between the two .
let me know your thoughts .

dale ,
thanks for your message .
i don ' t know the labor market in london that well but here the market
for quants is very hot . steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and i would go an extra mile to retain him long - term for the company .
i would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit .
o 62 , 000 basic is what anjam is receiving currently ( if i remember
correctly ) . steve has a much higher value
to enron than anjam .
