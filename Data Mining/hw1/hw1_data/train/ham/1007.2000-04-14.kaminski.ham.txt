dear mr . mcsherry :
i am responding to your search for credit risk professionals on
the
enroncredit . com website . after working for seven years on credit
risk
management in a research and consulting capacity , i would like to transfer
my
experience in assessing credit risk modeling , information technology
and
methodology in complex top - tier institutions to an active credit
trading
managerial environment . i am excited about being involved in
trading ,
origination , risk management and r & d of credit derivatives .
i have seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and
management . i
have helped design , test and implement credit value - at - risk systems with
kmv
corp and with a major japanese bank . i was a major contributor at kmv
in
designing the expected default frequency model and i am thoroughly familiar
with
its assumptions , strengths , weaknesses and applications . i did the
empirical
research that lies behind the kmv default correlation model , the private
firm
edf model and i interfaced with j . p . morgan ( now r . m . g . ) personnel during
the
creation of the creditmetrics documentation .
i have excellent analytical , quantitative , statistical and programming
skills .
i studied finance extensively when i was a graduate student and i studied
credit
risk theory while i worked with kmv and arthur andersen . i am eager to join
the
credit derivative team at enroncredit . com where i am certain that my
combination
of quantitative research skills , credit risk consulting experience
and
technology expertise make me uniquely qualified to support the
credit
derivatives trading and risk management function .
