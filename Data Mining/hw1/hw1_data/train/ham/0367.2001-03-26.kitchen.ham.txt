lynch started out castigating ferc for the " failure to act " , sellers for high prices forcing ca into this action . has some charts in the press package . talked about how wonderful the govs proposals have been . said net short is 34 % . sellers " have us over a barrell " for those sales . attorney gen continues investigation of the sellers . these are all for going forward costs - - this doesn ' t address the " $ for the hot dog , which is being taken care of in sacramento . " she said these proposals ensure reliability and allow treasurer to issue bonds . continues to castigate ferc throughout the call . wants new appointments to ferc from the states - - " our cries have fallen on deaf ears "
lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow :
1 . wood ' s proposal - - modified - - order that the ious to pay the qfs beginning 4 / 1 on a going forward basis only . modified existing formula in section 390 ( legislative change to this section did not pass yet ) . shifts the srac gas index from topoc ( where wood says the prices are being mnipulated ) to malin , where prices have been more stable .
2 . sets the ca procurement adjustment - - orders the ious to pay the dwr for purchases . at one point she said that the order would be for all power for purchased by the state beginning jan 19 ; at another point she said that the payments are for going forward costs . " it ' s time to pay the power bills for california . " cpa calculated based on the " residual " method , rather than the proportional method . payments to dwr made on the proportional method , however .
3 . lynch alternate setting a 3 cents / kwh increase in accordance with ab lx . ( the alj decision said no rate increase . ) makes the 1 cent temp charge permanent ( we believe that this is additive with the 3 cents - 4 cent total ) believe this covers all needs on a going forward basis . according to abx 1 , small customers with 130 % over baseline get no increase , small customers with 200 % increase , get a 9 % increase - - the rest get socked , i guess . adopted turn ' s accounting proposal implying that the rate freeze is not yet over . will look at rate design in a future proceeding . takes ious 30 - 45 days to charge the rates ( although could come earlier ) ; will conduct a rate design proceeding during that time period ( see # 5 ) .
4 . orders an investigation into the utility holding company structure to see if it is best for the public utilities to be outside holding companies .
a new proceeding was also identified .
5 . lynch is issuing an assigned comissioner ruling proposing a new rate structure . ( i presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use ) need information from dwr to calculate rates and dwr has not yet provided it . described the need to have a record on this . as mentioned in # 3 above - - would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30 - 45 days .
in one of the above orders , lynch said that she orders the utililities to go after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices .
