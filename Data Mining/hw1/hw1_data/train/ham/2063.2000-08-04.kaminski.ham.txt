krishna ,
osman has informed me that he has been requested to provide research services
to a larger number of clients in ees , leaving him less time to contribute to
our work here at the eam desk . while i am happy for him and believe that the
company will benefit from his services , i am concerned that he may not be
available at a crucial time in the development of the eam option strategy .
the eam desk is continuing to develop standard models for the bulk of our ecm
projects . we have hired 4 people in the past month and all of them will be
working by early september . osman provides an important link for our new
staff to several core areas of our business . first , his experience with
modeling and energy analysis are invaluable . second , as we move to treating
our projects as options , and pricing them as such , osman will be needed to
assist us in creating auditable methods to assess savings volatility .
i am expecting two of the team members to start in san francisco in the near
future . my request is for osman to be available to this team for one day a
week for the next several months , preferably until christmas .
thank you for your consideration of this matter .
