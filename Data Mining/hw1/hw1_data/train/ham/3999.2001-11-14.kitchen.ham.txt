with project spark gap , we have identified and are managing our top systems gaps and priorities for the next year . we are setting up sap codes for these efforts in order to more closely monitor it progress and spending . we have coordinated and are combining our systems requirements with the west and canada desks in order to present a global power strategic systems vision .
the following whs / retail systems analysis effort has made it clear that we should integrate our wholesale and retail trading systems , however , we believe organizational changes will be required in it and trading support to achieve the benefits and savings .

subject : whs / retail systems integration analysis - results / recommendations
under the direction of tim belden , kevin presto , lloyd will , anthony dayao and beth perlman , todd busby and i have completed the 3 week analysis of wholesale and retail power systems integration . enclosed are the preliminary executive summary presentation and the detailed information / process flow diagrams .
in summary , we identified at a high level commonality and critical dependencies across all main trading functions within retail and wholesale . in order to ensure successful integration of systems and processes , the team has identified the following recommendations :
1 . consider aligning the wholesale and retail support organizations with the gas and power trading .
2 . manage business systems requirements for power globally with a program management team sponsored by the business owners . consider program managers responsible for the following three areas :
trading - top priority to provide wholesale and retail positions and booking of shaped deals
billing / settlements & volume management - top priority to provide retail solutions and develop global strategic systems ( gas & power )
risk - top priority to provide retail valuation and liquidation
we will schedule a meeting next week to review the results of our analysis . i look forward to receiving your inputs .
thank you for your support on this effort .
