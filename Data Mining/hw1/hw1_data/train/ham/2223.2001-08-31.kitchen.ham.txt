subject : ena research : argentina default and devaluation risk rises . brazil feels the effects of the contagion
date : 12 july 2001
from : maureen raymond - castaneda

we believe that the risk of an argentine debt default has increased and peso devaluation risk has also risen substantially in the last several days .
due to recent economic and fiscal developments in argentina , we believe :
argentina lacks the fiscal and monetary maneuverability to lift itself out of a 3 - year recession ( exacerbated by a global slowdown ) and a strong peso . argentina ' s fiscal position has weakened substantially due to economic weakness that limits government revenue receipts needed to balance the fiscal deficit and pay off the country ' s debt service . a loss of investor confidence has caused spreads to widen despite argentina ' s need to rollover about $ 8 bn of short - term letes ( argentine government debt ) by the end of the year . yields paid at this week ' s treasury auction are at levels that are not sustainable over the medium - term . three - month treasury yields are 14 . 01 % ( versus 9 . 1 % paid at auction on june 26 and 7 . 89 % on june 12 ) . in addition to suffering from widening yields , argentina was forced to shorten the tenor of debt from a mix of 6 - month and 1 - year bonds issued previously to only 3 - month securities at this week ' s auction due to increased risk aversion to longer - term government paper by local investors ( pension funds and banks ) . the sharp increase in letes yields , and the inability to issue longer maturities , is highly indicative of the difficulty the argentine government will have in rolling over $ 8 bn in short - term paper over the remainder of the year at sustainable rates , which further weakens its fiscal position due to higher interest payments .
the recession has been exacerbated by the strong peso caused by the persistently strong us dollar , which has hurt argentina ' s export competitiveness especially vis - a - vis the brazilian real that has depreciated about 25 % relative to the usd since the beginning of the year . as a result to these factors , we believe the risks of argentine debt default and peso devaluation are mounting .
argentina is increasingly vulnerable to a run on the banking system . argentines are switching from peso to dollar deposits . argentina ' s limited forex reserves constrain the central bank ' s ability to support the peso , if private sector deposits are withdrawn or converted into u . s . dollars . private sector deposits of $ 74 bn are 33 % peso - denominated , or $ 25 bn , and 67 % are foreign currency - denominated deposits , which dwarf argentina ' s official forex reserves of $ 25 bn . total private sector deposits fell about $ 5 bn ( from $ 77 . 5 bn to $ 72 . 4 bn ) between february and end - april this year before stabilizing at $ 74 bn as of july 6 th .
political uncertainty is very high and throws into serious doubt economic minister cavallo ' s ability to win opposition support for a new fiscal austerity program announced late yesterday . cavallo needs to win approval for his fiscal agenda not only at the national level , but also at the provincial level , which will not be easy considering the 3 - year contraction . failure to gain this support to cutback spending will worsen argentina ' s fiscal woes , and cause a further deterioration of investor confidence .
these external and internal pressures leave the exchange rate vulnerable to speculative attack and threaten the 1 - to - 1 dollar peg , especially in light of the country ' s limited foreign exchange reserves . today , argentina ' s 1 - month ndf traded at pl . 15 , implying risk of a 15 % devaluation , while yesterday , the 1 - month ndf traded at pl . 05 ( implying an increased probability of devaluation since yesterday ) . also today , the 1 - year ndf traded at 1 . 25 , implying a 25 % devaluation . as a result of these above internal and external pressures , we believe the risk of peso devaluation has increased substantially .
the danger of a steep devaluation is that private sector firms that hold dollar - denominated debt and are long pesos and short dollars will suffer from sharply higher debt payments . this could cripple an already tenuous economic situation by causing a further deterioration in government revenue through lower tax receipts .
developments in argentina impact brazil through 3 main channels :
currency volatility : contagion from argentina has lead to a substantially weaker brazilian real . triggered by a general sell off of argentine stocks , bonds and currency , the real has depreciated 24 % since the beginning of the year to close today at r 2 . 55 . to stem the real ' s recent decline , central bank president fraga hiked interest rates 150 bp and simultaneously intervened in the forex market june 22 , which stemmed the real ' s depreciation for about one week ( see gmm , 29 june ) . recent currency volatility could result in further central bank intervention by drawing on brazil ' s forex reserves . fraga has indicated the central bank will intervene to support the real ' s value . a weak real will also translate into higher inflation expectations in brazil .
emerging market credit spreads : argentina represents about 25 % of total emerging market debt traded . current investor concern about argentina has consequently widened emerging market debt spreads . wider spreads put upward pressure on overnight rates in brazil , reducing liquidity and increasing costs of debt service in brazil .
trade mechanism : further downward pressure on economic output in brazil ( already aggravated by the drought - induced energy crisis ) brought on by weaker export market growth to argentina . also , the weaker argentine peso would reduce brazil ' s export competitiveness within the mercosur trade bloc .
this week ' s gmm will contain more details on the contagion effects on brazil as well as argentina ' s disappointing treasury bill auction , the trend in private sector deposits , cavallo ' s new fiscal measures to cut spending , argentina ' s heightened political risk associated with the need for fiscal austerity amid concerns over provincial political support and s & p ' s debt downgrade to " b - " , which is one notch below moody ' s rating of " b 2 " .
