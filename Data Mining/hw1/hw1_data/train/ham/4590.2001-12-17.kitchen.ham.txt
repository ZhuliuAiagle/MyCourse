sorry its all prepetition .
i already claimed the flights , now i will not be using them as i can not go home . i am using the money to pay for my parents ' s flights although not all of the money will be used . the rest of the money i intend to offset against expense checks which bounced . should there be an imbalance - i will sort this out with enron once payments have been completed on expense checks .
ok ?

ordinarily fine , however ;
this was a pre - petition commitment by enron and is not necessarily now a commitment of the estate
presuming we get purchased , things should return to normal presuming the buyer honors all these commitment ( that ' s how we have set it up ) .

as you know i have business flights home each year under my contract . as i will be unable to travel to the uk due to the requirement to be in houston over the holidays i intend to use them for my parents , borther and sister - in - law . any difference in the cost i intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether enron intends to meet expense payments .
