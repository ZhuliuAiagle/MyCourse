Subject: yesterday ' s power outage
as you are painfully aware , we had a power outage wednesday morning in the
enron building . this outage was caused by localized structural failure of
the raised floor in our 34 th floor data center . this resulted in disruption
to the power distribution system servicing the phone switch and a number of
ena servers .
as a cautionary move , enron online was interrupted while the extent of the
failure was assessed , resulting in the system being unavailable from 11 : 23 to
11 : 39 . all enron building telephones and voicemail were unavailable for
approximately one hour and 20 minutes and certain ena trading systems were
unavailable for over two hours . during this time the power was stabilized
and systems were restored . immediate steps are being taken to correct this
problem .
we apologize for this inconvenience .
