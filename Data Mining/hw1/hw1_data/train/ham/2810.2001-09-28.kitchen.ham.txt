ees is now fully stepping into the texas wholesale market with this . talking to 70 municipals for aggregated power is ridiculous for ees to be doing . this has to be stopped along with ees providing the " whitepaper " products where they are providing wholesale products to san antonio and others . they are making enron look stupid in not communicating what they are doing with the wholesale desk when we are constantly finding out they are talking to customers in our sic codes that we have been working with toward a deal .
i think a meeting needs to be setup between lavorato and delainey or at your level to get this fixed . i have tried working with my peers at ees and they continue to lie to me and keep working customers in our sic code and even worse with iou ' s and municipals .

tom ,
will you be available for the following visit ? this is another large group . . . in order to keep this from being disruptive , we were thinking of dividing the group into two for two separate overviews . these overviews should only be 10 minutes in length . one would be at 11 : 00 am and the other at 11 : 15 am .
let me know if this is a possibility .
thanks .
