alex , i ' m glad that we had a chance to talk today about a weatherdelta
overview . the 8 th is not really going to work well for us , due to recent
reschedulings . several members of the weatherdelta team will be in or near
houston on the 14 th and 15 th of november ( i know that you said that week was
tight ) , and could arrange to be in the several weeks following those dates .
i have attached our standard non - disclosure agreement , which we will need to
execute prior to the product demonstration . i have also attached a reprint
of a recent article , describing weatherdelta ' s approach and functionality .
as soon as a meeting can be scheduled , a list of attendees would be very
helpful to us in preparing the appropriate materials .
thank you again ,
michael denton
