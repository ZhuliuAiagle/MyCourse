vince ,
here are the overview powerpoint slides for the investment and strategic
relationship management firm , azure capital , i mentioned in my voice
mail . the transactions they completed in their past lives at csfb and
already in the new firm , as well as their advisory board are probably
the strongest evidence of their capabilities .
hope all is well .
