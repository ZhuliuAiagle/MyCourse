subject : re - start / integration planning
we have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the re - start / integration plans for netco . so far , we have primarily focussed on the mid / back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors . several plans are in the final stages of completion including : -
+ infrastructure jenny rub
+ development jay webb
+ enrononline webb / forster
+ hr david oxley
+ cash management tom myers
+ credit debbie brackett
the rest will be completed shortly .
we now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus . john and i would like to receive the plans " re - start / integration " plans by january 7 th , 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups . the focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible . i have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but i thought it might help . please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually .
customer side
+ customers phase 1 - first week ( eg top 10 )
phase 2 - first month ( eg top 50 )
phase 3 - first quarter ( eg top 100 )
+ action plan phase 1 customers
phase 2 customers
phase 3 customers
+ contracts by customers ( pre - prepared with credit terms etc )
+ customer visit schedule
product side
+ list of products phase 1 - first week
phase 2 - first month
phase 3 - first quarter
target number of transactions
+ phase 1
+ phase 2
+ phase 3
it transfer
