Subject: re : ubs notes at ferc mtg
i based the code of conduct on what sam behrends had drafted for
the netco mbr application ; as you suggest , it may be preferable to
use the code that epmi or pge uses . one other thing that we still
need to focus on is the undertaking in footnote 17 of the february
1 draft concerning standards of conduct for the pipelines , or at
least transwestern . .

looks good . i need to find a different version of code of conduct
that
more closely mimics epmi and pge version . the agreement in
appendix b
right now may be too restrictive for our current dealings .
agree that we need to finish up details of ( a ) data transfer and
( b )
transistional services agreement .
in my discussions on friday , the transitional services will be
" agent " type
activities . enron needs help in making sure that it can service
its
contracts . no ubs warburg energy employee will make commercial
decisions
for enron - simply perform directed activities .
the question of data transferred is still outstanding , but i will
hopefully
know more on monday am . i am checking on exactly how much
counterparty
info will be held by ubs warburg energy .
i plan on being in your office first thing tues am .
thanks ,
jim

here is what i had come up with . my thought is that the bold
roman
numeral headings would make up an agenda , which we should send
to
cindy marlette on monday , along with a list of those who will
attend for ubs . the subheadings , which would not appear on the
what we send to ferc , would be the main items for discussion .
i don ' t think your approach and mine are very far apart . i
might
be somewhat less affirmative about raising the section 203
issue .
it will surely come up as we describe what will or will not be
transferred .
i also think it would be very helpful to clear up the points
about
the approach to existing enron customers , and the transitional
arrangements before the meeting i would like , in any event , to
put something into the mbr application on transition
arrangements
that is more definitive - - in the right way - - than footnote 12 of
the
draft i sent out yesterday .

here is a draft of some talking points on the ferc meeting .
may
need to shorten . i am very concerned about the data ubs will
acquire and the access to contracts , and implications for 203 .
