i just spoke with the office of the chairman and have learned that ken and
jeff are actually available during the morning of december 19 th from 8 : 00 am
until 11 : 00 am . as a result , our plans have changed just a little and i have
requested whether or not they are willing to pose for polaroid pictures with
employees - i ' ll let you know what i find out ! we will still have the jazz
duet and informational poster displays in the lobby throughout the day and
instead of dessert items , we ' ll order breakfast stuff .
