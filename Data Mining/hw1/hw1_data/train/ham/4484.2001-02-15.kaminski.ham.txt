michelle ,
cecil and david ' s code was correct but could not match ken ' s spreadsheet
output due to a slight mis - specification in ken ' s excel spreadsheet . the code
was then modified to conform with ken ' s specification and results very close
to that of ken were obtained . as of now ken ' s modifying his spreadsheet to
re - run the results , the original correct code will be restored , and we will
see what
happens then . anyway this is rather encouraging .
best ,
alex
