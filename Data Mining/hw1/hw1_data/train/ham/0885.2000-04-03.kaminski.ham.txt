hello vince ,
i didn ' t know if that was your correct e - mail address listed below on
receiving from outside the company , so i thought i would forward this with a
couple of comments .
she states below that she has enclosed a proposal , however , the only pricing
i really see is in the software license agreement , article 2 , which states
that the license fee is $ 100 , 000 and lists out when you must pay for it . it
then states in article 3 that the fees are set forth in appendix 1 , but there
are no prices in appendix 1 .
i have reviewed the actual terms and conditions to the license and am going
to prepare it as we usually do to send to mark holsworth for review . in the
meantime , do you want me to go back to ms . geman and ask her for more
detailed pricing information or do you have what you need ? also , in appendix
2 , you will need to list the number of sites and workstations you want to
have .
please let me know .
thanks ,
karla

dear ms . feldman ,
please find enclosed a proposal for the d - g energy
software license agreement in which enron may be
interested . we deliberately left blank the appendix 2
related to the number of sites and workstations it
would cover , in order to let dr . kaminski decide what
is best for enron .
sincerely
