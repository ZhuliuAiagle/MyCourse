Subject: alternative names
kal came up with a couple of suggestions :
" traderkey "
" quoteskey "
- consistent with other ubs products ( like swisskey )
- few syllables
- doesn ' t use the ubs name , so shouldn ' t be as sensitive to the name police
- is generic enough to survive ubs name changes or other companies posting products on the site in the future .
- are available as a url
i especially like " traderkey " , which has positive connotations and provides potential for some interesting marketing campaigns .
