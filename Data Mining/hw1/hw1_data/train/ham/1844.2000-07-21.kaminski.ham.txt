Subject: cmu students
i have given your email to richard bryant , who is the director of the comp .
fin . program at cmu . no doubt he will be in touch . here ' s a link :
i feel that i should mention something : from my experience at cmu , there are
three types of students . those that work very very hard and are basically
ethical ; those that cheat their way through school , and the sharks . it is
very difficult to distinguish between the groups when interviewing . in my
class of about 30 students , there were three sharks , about six or seven hard
workers , and then there was everyone else . anyway , for what its worth !
