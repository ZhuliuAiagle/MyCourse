i ' d like to discuss everett . i have to say i would have put huge money on you telling me to jump in the lake if i had suggested him . if beth does go i would have thought anthony would be the more obvious choice . why is everyone suddenly buying everett ' s stock - has fallon been doing a sales job ?

no idea about beth - she hasn ' t come to see me since she got back . but i think if she does move then everett is the perfect fit and as that group ' s customer i ' m willing to give it a shot .

hi louise ,
i heard on the grapevine that you might be considering beth for a commerical role - true or false ?
i also heard you were interested in plante as a replacement - true or false ?

best regards
