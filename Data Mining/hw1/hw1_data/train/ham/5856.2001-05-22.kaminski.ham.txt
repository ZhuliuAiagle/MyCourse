i would like you to put me in contact with s / one at enron here in london that
deals with weather derivatives and would be in a position to sell us options on
weather derivatives ( temperature , cat ) . let me know if you are able to do that
or if i need to work internally here in order to find out whom we have contacts
with at enron .
if you want to call me my direct line is + 44 207 336 - 2836 . alternatively i could
call you but do bear in mind that i leave the office around 6 : 30 - 7 pm london
time . send me an email and let me know when is a good time to talk and i will
call you back .
thanks in advance .
antonella
