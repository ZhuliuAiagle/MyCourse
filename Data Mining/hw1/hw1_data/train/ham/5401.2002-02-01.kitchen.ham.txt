Subject: portland office
my name is tim belden and i manage the west power trading desk in portland . louise kitchen suggested that i get in touch with you .
i spoke to marcus beurgler on tuesday about the portland office . i indicated to him our desire to move . we discussed an interim period in this office until we can move elsewhere . i learned yesterday that enron has accepted the lease on this office space . i was not aware that this was happening and am told that we are now stuck here for the term of the lease which is three to five years .
based on very preliminary assessment it looks like it may be cost effective to move from here . we currently occupy 20 , 000 square feet when we only need roughly 10 , 000 . if we remain in this building there is a significant cost associated with physically separating our phones and computers from portland general electric . everyone here would like to move .
what i need to know is the following :
is ubs warburg obligated at this point in time to take on the lease for our current space ? if yes , can this be undone ? if no , when will this decision be made ?
if we are obligated to take this space , who do i need to talk to within ubs about negotiating with portland general electric to get out of the lease . i have very good relationships with portland general electric so i think that they would work with us on this .
i can be reached at 503 - 464 - 3820 or 503 - 701 - 7278 .
thanks ,
tim belden
