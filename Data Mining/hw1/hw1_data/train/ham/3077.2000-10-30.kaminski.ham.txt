thanks - based on a " speed read " it would appear that srm sits neatly in the
volumetric part of your framework . regarding systems i am keen to preserve
the work kevin has already done and i suspect we can eventually use the
visualization tools in the risktrac front end to display the results should
we require .
to be honest , i feel a good deal more comfortable that there is already a
framework and initiative in place - its very easy to feel like the " angry
lone voice " in an effort like this - fortunately the practitioners of the art
of risk management generally travel in a similar direction !
i shall make sure our efforts remain in congruence .
