Subject: hr ' s list
louise : who in hr is providing you with a list and what is the purpose of the list ? we can verify that they are still with the company and that they are still getting paid , but knowing the source of the list you refer to from hr and the purpose of the list will allow us to get to the heart of the communication problem . - - sally
