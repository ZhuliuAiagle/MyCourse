louise ,
the attached dash is not final , but may circulate later today . mark haedicke has the legal risk memo - the attorney ( karen jones ) characterizes the risk as very low ( our information and knowledge reps are qualified and capped at 10 % ) . we are hoping to sign as early as today or monday , but funding may not occur until after sep 30 ( we will push hard to get funds in this quarter ) . regardless of cash timing , income recognition of approx $ 1 mm can be accounted for in q 3 as planned .
regards ,
