Subject: impending visit july 5 - 7
vince :
i plan to be in houston on july 5 - 7 . i would like very much to get together
with you and perhaps your investment guy on friday morning on the 7 th if you
and / or he have the time or perhaps on the 5 th in the afternoon . i would
like to continue the discussions about your using marketpoint and about your
investment guy considering marketpoint if he is interested . when you see
the progress we have made , i think you will agree that it merits
consideration as a part of enrononline . com as well as a profitable
investment in its own right . it is still in the situation where it can be
provided exclusively to whomever i choose ; i have been very , very careful
how i have promoted it so that i do not get committed to a second - rate
partner .
i also have what i think is a fundamentally new , general markovian forward
optionality evaluator . i wrote my ph . d . dissertation at stanford in the
1970 s ( defended with honors ) in semi - markovian decision processes during the
heyday of that research , and i have seen direct applications in optionality
evaluation . i think you will be fascinated to see and review it . it is
presently implemented in prototype form and it could be made available to
the first large retainer client on an exclusive basis who is sufficiently
interested . if you want to be that retainer client , that would be of
interest to me .
give me a shout via return email or by my cell phone at 650 . 218 . 3069
regarding schedule . i am out of town this week but available via email or
phone at the above addresses .
i really hope we can get together that week if we possibly can . thanks very
much for considering my request , and thanks very much for being the go
between with your investment guy . i deeply appreciate it . i hope to see
you on the 5 th or 7 th .
