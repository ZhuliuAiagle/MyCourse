Subject: re : clayton vernon
i have some concerns regarding vernon being able to transfer even if he is
temporarily successful with deliverables defined for him . according to enron
policy , an employee can only transfer if he is in satisfactory standing or
better . this is to prevent problem employees being moved from one
organization to the another . this sounds like a " work ethic " issue to me and
the chances that it would continue in another department are great even if he
is temporarily successful . but if kevin presto knows the situation and he
still wants vernon in the end , i will push for an exception as this satisfies
our obligation to be forthright . please keep me informed of clayton ' s
progress as time goes on so we do not get criticized for passing on a problem
employee . thanks .

kevin ,
vasant and i talked to clayton about his request for transfer . clayton
received a conditional approval contingent
upon completion of the current project he works on . vasant will formulate
exact definition of the deliverables
and we will hold clayton to it . if he fails to deliver the request for
transfer will be rejected . anything else
would be highly demoralizing to everybody .
clayton has so far produced exactly zero ( no single output was delivered )
though he was advertising
the projects inside and outside the group as completed . i want you to be
aware of it , because i have
serious doubts regarding clayton ' s integrity .
