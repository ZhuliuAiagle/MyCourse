trading , market development ( history of nat gas , electricity , etc . ) , pricing ,
etc . . .
john ' s people will do similar mini presentations on optical network
engineering , optical components , provisioning , telecom markets , pricing ,
etc . . . .
if scott yeager can make it , he will do his magic via quick motivational
speech on the vision of ebs , etc . .
it is will be strictly technical to technical professional meeting to get to
know each others group . so , do not include others unles stinson or i look at
the additions case - by - case .
john suggested scott yeager ' s summar house in denver for this event . please

has not told him so you should explain the intend , etc . ) to get in touch with
scott . i ' ll cc this e - mail to give scott a heads up .
