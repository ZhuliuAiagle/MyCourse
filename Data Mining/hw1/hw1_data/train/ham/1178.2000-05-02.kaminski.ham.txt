Subject: making room for " summer interns "
hello all :
i have some " good " news and i have some " bad " news . the " good " news
is that we are growing ! the " bad " news is that we are running out of space .
therefore , just for the summer we need to use jose ' s and joe ' s offices
on the 19 th floor for " summer " interns .
i will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won ' t be
ringing all the time . however , we can put them back after the summer is
over .
i hope this is not too inconvenient for you , but with roman and jason needing
spaces on the 19 th floor , and another new hire coming on board , we are left
without any extra spaces .
thanks !
