cpuc delays qf payment vote
sources believe that the delay in the puc vote on paying the qfs 15 % of their undercollected debt is likely a result from both a concern about bankruptcy issues raised by issuing what could be seen as a " preference payment " to the qfs ( the puc does follow these issues out of necessity , given the current environment ) and a lack of clarity regarding how to implement the 15 % payment . the delay was unsurprising and characteristic of how the puc operates . it is also noted that there are many claims on socal ' s and pg & e ' s cash flows currently . additionally , agreeing to pay 15 % of debts to the qfs raises legal issues , in that the utilities would be paying debts to some creditors , but not others . this could increase the likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against socal by the non - qf creditors .
