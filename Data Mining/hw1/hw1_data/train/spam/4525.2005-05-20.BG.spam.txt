may 18 - - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - teievision and teiecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they wouid reguiate voice over internet protocol
( voip ) service oniy when it is provided and used as local teiephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to build
sustainable competition in local telephone markets , the incumbent carriers
will not be permitted to price their | ocal voip services below cost to
stifie competition .

the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , " stated jan oiiver , ceo of nomad

the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its

u . s . aione , there are over 2 oo , oo 0 , 000 users of the internet . of the
total users in the u . s . , the tota | number of users of broadband is oniy
approximateiy 4 o , oo 0 , ooo ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore
represents approximateiy 80 % of the entire internet connectivity market .

higher .

providers not only offers significant potentia | for market penetration ,
