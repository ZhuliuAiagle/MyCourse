may 18 - - nomad internationa | inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - television and telecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they wouid regulate voice over internet protoco |
( voip ) service oniy when it is provided and used as | oca | telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to buiid
sustainabie competition in loca | telephone markets , the incumbent carriers
wiil not be permitted to price their local voip services below cost to
stifle competition .

the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cable companies and virtual operators . the ruling permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , " stated jan oiiver , ceo of nomad

the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the ability of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dial - up customers . though

woridwide , dial - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . aione , there are over 200 , 0 oo , ooo users of the internet . of the
tota | users in the u . s . , the tota | number of users of broadband is oniy
approximately 4 o , 0 oo , ooo ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dia | - up therefore
represents approximateiy 80 % of the entire internet connectivity market .

higher .
nomad ' s ability to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
