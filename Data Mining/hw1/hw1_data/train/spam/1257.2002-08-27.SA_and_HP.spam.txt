pick # 2 - enbc began its ' heavy move up over 200 % hitting a high of over 300 % . . .
our latest discovery : xrmd - several investment reporters featured xraymedia during fiscal 2001 / 02 . at the time , we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company ' s direct sourcing technology solutions , and so far the company has delivered . although the company has raised just $ 2 million in the two years it has been developing its ’ technology , it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the live media marketplace expected revenues to $ 3 - 5 mm during fiscal 2003 , driving the line in 2004 to $ 15 - 25 mm . this remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers . the company saves advertising buyers up to 70 % in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect , by saving time & efforts , cutting telephone and faxing bills , while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the internet , we ’ ve never seen anything like it !
how does the company do this ?
xraymedia ( otcbb : xrmd ) the company founded xraymedia in march 2000 to create a " mass source to advertising sector " live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the company ’ s ’ strengths , serving both large and small united states and international customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public . * * * with the use of proprietary software , it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users ’ criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves .
their " source to business model " , eliminates two levels of hindrance ( sourcing and limited opportunities ) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost .
while investors have thrown money recklessly at money - losing technology companies , here is a company that will increase revenues from $ 1 to $ 25 million in three years , and grow profitability substantially with little funding . xraymedia is among the best performing sectors since september 11 th , and we feel that xraymedia is likely to break through its 52 - week high of $ 00 . 19 soon .
