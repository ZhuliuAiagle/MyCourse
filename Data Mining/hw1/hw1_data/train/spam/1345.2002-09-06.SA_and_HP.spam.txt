it would be much more useful to the industry , if spfa would help find a " code conforming " fire barrier for attics , crawl spaces etc . , than lecture on fast and loose applications of code . something about 30 cents ( a bd . ft . ) installed , meeting all codes and spray applied . many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect but they haven ' t spent the money to test over foam . maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products , report results to spfa , who in turn will " acquire funding " from us .

we are in australia but we are finding it hard to locate polyurea sprayers here so that we can start a chapter of the pda do u have any list of australian contractors / suppliers ? ? ? ? or maybe they can put their hand up and lets us know at enviroline @ powerup . com . au , it isfor the betterof the game that an association is need to inform clients and specifiers of the uses and properties of polyureas and train its own members , also to keep cowboys out that give the industry a bad name

i ' m sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a " thermal barrier " . what the hell do you think foam is ? if you are saying that anything that can be forced to burn should be covered with a fireproof barrier , then you ' d better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely not carrying a class one fire rating . this double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it . icynene is different . it doesn ' t burn alone . it doesn ' t melt . it doesn ' t emit phosgene . does it smoke in a fire situation ? sure , so what ?
blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car . get real , inspectors . you want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that doesn ' t burn !
as for the vaunted r rating system , it is totally bogus . the test is designed to make porous insulations appear to perform better than they actually do . measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer , the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is 20 years ago , along with that obsolete fiberglassgarbage they ' re still selling everybody . there ' s a reason they don ' t make refrigerators , freezers coolers coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose . think about it .

thank you , mark and dik , for your statements above . i also feel that far too often individuals and companies are too complacent and quietly live with rules and regulations without trying to change them - even if everybody knows they do not make sense . we are all experts and representatives of this industry and should speak up and promote change !

there has been a lot of talk about ceramic coatings . we are a distributor of such a coating . we have never professed an r - 20 . reason = is there isn ' t an astm test available to measure coatings for r - value . we compare standardized insulation to ceramic coatings via btu loss calculations . depending on the criteria we can equal 2 to 3 inches of standard insulation with an aluminum jacket . we have the data and the projects to prove it .
