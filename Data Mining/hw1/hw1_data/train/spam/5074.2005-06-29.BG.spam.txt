registered pooled development fund ( pdf ) . pdfs offer a number of
significant tax concessions to investors as dividends are exempt

fluxstar : under an
exclusive agreement , egty plans to manufacture and market a simple
magnetic device that enhances the efficiency of ac and dc motors .
it is anticipated that the fluxstar magnetic source of power will
provide an alternative source of energy and power for homes around
the world . the objective of this
technology is to eventually eliminate utility bills for the end
user .
global cedar : in
addition to manufacturing furniture , the company intends to sell
and distribute its proprietary product , the global cedar tree , in
order to foster the growth of plantations that provide timber for
construction , furniture building , wood pulp , and other products .
the tree grows well in a variety of climactic conditions , and the
plantlets contain no contaminants and are subject to no known
import / export restrictions . therefore , the marketability ofthis
product is extremely high .
the global cedar treeis the result of 14
years of research and genetic technology development . it
is the fastest growing hardwood tree on the planet , capable of
achieving growth levels of 30 - 35 feet in its first year alone !
after just the first year , the tree can be harvested and will
re - grow from the stump , providing multiple harvests for years . the
timber produced is excellent for fine furniture and other uses for
which the wood of fast growing soft woods is unsuitable . the
potential benefits of the tree are legion , from positive effects
on the ozone and a buffer against rainforest depletion , as world
demand for wood products continues to outpace world supply .
