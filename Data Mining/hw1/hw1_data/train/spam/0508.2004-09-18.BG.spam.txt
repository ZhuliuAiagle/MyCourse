a high level cognition module fig . 3 ? the " pygmie " reduced from tyson ' s figure 1 , 1699 . " he differeth not from a man but in his legs ; for they have [ 6 ] no calfe . hee goeth alwaies upon his legs , and carrieth his hands clasped in the nape of his necke when he goeth upon the ground . they sleepe in the trees , and build shelters for the raine . they feed upon fruit that they find in the woods , and upon nuts , for they eate no kind of flesh . they cannot speake , and have no understanding more than a beast . the people of the countrie , when they travaile in the woods make fires where they sleepe in the night ; and in the morning when they are gone , the pongoes will come and sit about the fire till it goeth out ; for they have no understanding to lay the wood together . they goe many together and kill many negroes that travaile in the woods . many times they fall upon the elephants which come to feed where they be , and so beate them with their clubed fists , and pieces of wood , that they will runne roaring away from them . those pongoes are never taken alive because they are so strong , that ten men cannot hold one of them ; but yet they take many of their young ones with poisoned arrowes .
reality itself which i hope to have shown is possible . which claimed to be a complete mathematical system . what g?del showed in more understandable words were
arguing so the space is limited - which makes it hard to have a dog the promised further investigations were never carried out ; and so it happened that the pongo of von wurmb took its place by the side of the chimpanzee , gibbon , and orang as a fourth and colossal species of man - like ape . and indeed nothing could look much less like the chimpanzees or the orangs , then known , than the pongo ; for all the specimens of chimpanzee and orang which had been observed were small of [ 27 ] stature , singularly humans in aspect , gentle and docile ; while wurmb ' s pongo was a monster almost twice their sizes of vast strength and fierceness , and very brutal in expression ; its great projecting muzzle , armed with strong teeth , being further disfigured by the outgrowth of the cheeks into fleshy lobes .
these characters , even without tyson ' s good figure ( figs . 3 and 4 ) , would have been sufficient [ 13 ] to prove his " pygmie " to be a young chimpanzee . non - humans and technologies . in particular the internet offers a way to create / expand collectives and exchange / gain knowledge at a speed that has not been present before . lots of theories concerning cyberculture do have a tremendous faith in technologies but to be part of them you will need more than everyday computer skills . this leads me to ask the question if we are going to see the end of corporations such as microsoft through systems as gnutella ? to this i think the answer is no . sure
