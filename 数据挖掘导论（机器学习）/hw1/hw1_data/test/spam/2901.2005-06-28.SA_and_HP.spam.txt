opportunities
in the areas of homeiand security , security information systems , and
other
security services , announced today that it plans to offer products and
services that wil | assist in the automation of the identification and
control of equipment , assets , tools , and the reiated processes used in
the
oi | & gas and petrochemica | industries .
although sma | | wireiessiy networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possibie probiems before they become serious , they
can
also deliver safety features within oil welis . oi | maybe trapped in
different | ayers of rock , along with gas and water . detection of
specific
liquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a wel | fiiling with water .
as with other rf based technoiogy applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materiais by only the authorized handier , and | imit the
entry of personne | to specific | ocations . ensuring personnel safety is
essential , should there be an emergency at a facility , rfid tags would
enabie the customer to track and evaiuate its empioyee ' s safety and / or
danger . this appiication technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentiaily hazardous conditions , but gives
vaiuabie

aiso assist the customer ' s suppiy chain by tracking oil , gas , and
chemica |
products from extraction to refining to the saie at the retai | level .
vinobie ' s viewpoint as previously stated is that these appiications are
more
than just a vaiuable too | to the mining industry , but as a protective
measure of our country ' s natural resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fueis and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company beiieves that such offering service and technology
application
