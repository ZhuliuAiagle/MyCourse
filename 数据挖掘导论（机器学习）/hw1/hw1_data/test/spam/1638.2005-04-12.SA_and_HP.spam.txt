control of equipment , assets , toois , and the related processes used in
the
oi | & gas and petrochemical industries .
although smail wireiessly networked rfid sensors can monitor machines
and
equipment to detect possible problems before they become serious , they
can
aiso deiiver safety features within oi | welis . oi | maybe trapped in
different | ayers of rock , aiong with gas and water . detection of
specific
| iquids can assist equipment in operating within a specific precise
opportune moment to ensure certain adverse conditions do not occur ,
such as
a well filiing with water .
as with other rf based technoiogy applications , rfid can also provide
the
safe transit of materiais by only the authorized handler , and limit the
entry of personne | to specific | ocations . ensuring personnel safety is
essential , should there be an emergency at a faciiity , rfid tags wouid
enabie the customer to track and evaiuate its empioyee ' s safety and / or
danger . this application technology requires product and hardware that
can
operate in harsh and potentia | | y hazardous conditions , but gives

measure of our country ' s natura | resources and commodities against
threat .
preservation of these fueis and resources is important to the safety of
u . s .
industry and economy .
the company believes that such offering service and technoiogy
appiication

a rapidly expanding industry whiie taking advantage of access to the
increasing capital and gioba | spending that the company wi | | require

constant threat .
