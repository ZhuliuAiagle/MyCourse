Subject: fw : cynthia franklin update
louise ,
per our conversation yesterday , i am hoping that the email from bob superty is sufficient correspondence to enable john to hire cindy franklin into the wellhead desk . please confirm this is correct by sending me or jeanie slone an email with your approval .
by the way , applied terravision is up again today ( + . 10 ) and has traded as high as 1 . 50 . the last trade was at 1 . 40 . in addition , i spoke with wes about having eight seats on the floor for the wellhead / ecommerce effort under john grass . i will have to meet with arnold today , because to individuals will have to move in order for me to have access to two vacant seats .
the need for eight seats is broken out as follows :
kathy kelly - wellhead
cindy franklin - wellhead
dayem khandker - wellhead / ecommerce
judy thorne - wellhead
john grass - wellhead / ecommerce
jean mrha
vacant - expected ecommerce originator need after expected closing of outsourcing deals
vacant - ecommerce associate / analyst
i am conflicted about having a seat on six and on five , but i think it is necessary from a management / business perspective . do you concur ?
regards , mrha
