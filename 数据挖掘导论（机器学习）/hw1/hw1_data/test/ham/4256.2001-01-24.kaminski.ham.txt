gentlemen ,
thank you for your time and consideration yesterday . i am excited about
working for enron and gladly accept your offer .
to reiterate our consensus today , i will be working an average of 10 hours a
week , mostly early mornings from around 5 to 7 . another option for me might
be to work mondays , wednesdays , and fridays from around 5 to 8 or 9 .
toni graham was my contact in hr six months ago . she is probably more
familiar with my previous file than anyone else . if you have any questions
or concerns please don ' t hesitate to contact me .
thank you ,
chris pernoud
