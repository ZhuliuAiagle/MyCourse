Subject: thanks for taking time this morning to go over some goals for enrononline . as far as i ' m concerned , the platform we have is astonishing , and i agree that the more we lengthen our lead over the competition ( in both trading and technology ) the better our chances of landing some private marketplace sales . to that end , jay and i will begin hounding the trading heads and rounding up development needs and potential enhancements to boost trade volume and revenue . also , we ' ll get kal focused on periodic face - lifts of the gui . then we will devote origination attention to third party sales which will validate our contention that the platform has value outside of its considerable worth to enron . if resources become constrained , it will simply mean that we are finding traction in the right places .
yes , i am excited about this job , and yes , i want to be in the hot seat you and greg are describing . i hope i can run ideas past you from time to time and i trust you will let me know when you have comments or concerns .
thanks ,
brad
