layla ,
a few points .
i shall be glad to attend the reception .
i am falling behind in getting my presentation ready . sorry for the delay .
i can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my
presentation
( or a day before ) . i have done it on two occasions before ( power 2000 and
power 1999 ) :
the copies were produced by our company copy center at no cost to you .
my associate , tanya tamarchenko , is helping me with one aspect of the
presentation and
i would like her to deliver part of my speach . it ' s only fair to give her the
credit when the
credit is due . is it ok to include her as an additional speaker ?

dear speaker ,
pre - congress cocktail reception - sunday 13 th may @ 5 : 30 pm in the juniper
room
we would be delighted to have you attend our pre - congress cocktail
reception . we will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors ,
exhibitors and eprm / risk waters group staff . we hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of eprm 2001 usa
+ rsvp
i would also like to remind you that i need any missing presentations by
thursday 3 rd may . it is essential that i get these in as the delegates rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs .
if you still haven ' t informed me of your av requirements , please do so as
quickly as possible . i also require a short biography .
i would like to point out that i will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event . if you are using a laptop , your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you . you must bring your own
laptop and disc , with connecting cables .
any questions , please do not hesitate to contact me .
kind regards
layla o ' leary
