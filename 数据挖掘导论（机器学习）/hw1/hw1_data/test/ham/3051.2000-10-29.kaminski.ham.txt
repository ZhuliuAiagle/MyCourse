tani ,
please touch base with lloyd fleming as to whom from rac should review the
methodology . i view that it is the commercial team ' s responsibility to post
the curve , operations responsibility to gather objective information on the
efficacy of the curve on a ( minimum ) monthly basis and report all highly
sensitive curves , rac will not approve or disapprove a curve but question
methodology / motivations and subsequent changes and do so in a senior
management forum ( i . e . , we will tell on those who have suspect curves or
curve movements ) . obviously , we are looking for the best estimate of the
value of those products in those time buckets today , we also favor object ,
consistent application of methodoology intra and inter commodity .

subject : copper curve
following steve ' s note to you earlier today , i wanted to mention that we have
a fairly urgent need for review of the copper curve in particular , as there
is a deal due for final pricing in the next few days .
i am not sure what data you have received from enron metals in london , so i
am asking tim poullain - patterson to ensure that you have the curves and the
economic justification proposed as soon as possible . please direct any
questions to him or to harry tefoglou . i will be in the tokyo office next
week , but available via e - mail .
thanks in advance for your assistance ,
