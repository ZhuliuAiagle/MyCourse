connie :
in response to your email to vince kaminski of 3 / 19 / 01 , the subject invoice
was sent to our accounting dept . for payment on february 25 , 2001 . we
did not need the spav maintenance , so we deducted $ 1 , 600 . 00 . did you
receive a payment in the amount of $ 4100 . 00 that could possibly have been
payment for this invoice ?
i have left a message for our accounting dept . to see exactly when the invoice
was paid and the check number . as soon as i hear from them i will left you
know .
best regards ,
