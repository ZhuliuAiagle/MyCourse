dear mr . fujita :
i will be glad to make the dinner arrangements . i will make reservations at
the " latour d ' argent " restaurant located at 2011 ella blvd at t . c . jester .
for 6 : 30 pm on the 17 th . they do require a coat .
i believe most of the cabs will know where it is - but just in case :
" take i - 45 north to 610 east , go to the ella blvd exit and turn left ( back
under the freeway ) on ella blvd . go to 2011 ella blvd . ( on the right ) . "
look forward to having you at enron .
thank you .
sincerely ,
