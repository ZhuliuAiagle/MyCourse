we will be handing this draft out today .
we met with goldman and citibank yesterday and have reviewed the regions macro econ status .
we need to get you more active in our activity . i do not think everyone knows your team exists . put john lavoratto , louise kitchens and jim hughes , stan horton on you e mail list at least . i would reccomend you set a meeting up with them directly to let them know what your team is doing . i will talk to them again today .
i am in houston next week . i will stop by .
good work everyone who saw the first draft was surprised we had this in house expertice .
