Subject: re : letter to nesbitt
vince ,
your note looks good to me , short and to the point .
i assume this will prompt further detailed discussions with dale . i would
want to clarify that we are primarily interested in the long term gas model
and database for north america . unless a familiarity with the short term
model is a prerequisite , i doubt that we would want to spend a lot of time on
it .
depending upon how long it would take to become familiar with the long term
model , it might be helpful to have access in both omaha and houston ?
we would eventually need specifications for the computer system we would need
for testing the model . steve hotte , cio for ets , would co - ordinate the
in - house installation for us . at some point , it will be helpful to get steve
in contact with the appropriate marketpoint it rep .
assuming that you get acceptable clarification of these issues , dale should
probably send to us a modified licensing agreement for review .
let me know what i should do next .
