vince ,
i work for the market risk rac london group . i review the quantitative issues
arising from enron europe models .
i am in this function given my background ( phd from imperial college - london )
and also due to my past experience
as risk manager for a brazilian investment bank and louis dreyfus .
my agenda includes the review of a number of deals ( wessex , tpl , eastern ,
. . . ) , as well as the
review of the construction of european gas and power price curves and their
respective volatility curves .
currently i am devoting most of my time to the analysis of the uk gas market ,
its respective
price curve and term structure of volatility .
bjorn and david suggested it could be very productive if i had the chance to
meet you and your team
to discuss issues related to modelling prices and risk measurement tools .
i will be in houston from the 10 th to 15 th september . i wonder if you could
book some time for me in
your agenda and also ask some members of your team to do the same .
thanks ,
rodrigo
