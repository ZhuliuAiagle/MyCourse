vince and stinson ,
i checked the file and the maintenance that automatically renews on 4 / 1 / 2000
is for the following products :
all 4 of your @ global licenses
spav
swing
i will go ahead and contact fea and see about getting the renewal invoice for
these . i ' ll send it to shirley for payment once i have it .
the products : @ interest , seapc , and seapp have not been on maintenance for a
while . fea told us a couple of years ago i believe that they do not have
maintenance available for these products any longer . so , you don ' t need to
worry about cancelling @ interest .
also , just fyi - your @ energy . 1 and @ energy . 2 licenses have maintenance
through 10 / 20 / 2000 .
if you have any questions , please let me know . otherwise , i will proceed
with contacting fea about you renewal of the @ global , spav , and swing
licenses .
thanks ,
karla
