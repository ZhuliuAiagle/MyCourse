subject : weekly report
hi david ,
i understand that you were slightly upset over a comment kevin kindall made
in one of his weekly reports . the wording was unfortunate , but the intention
was never to disparage anybody . it is just that since research gets data
from a large number of sources , we feel obligated to the data donor to ask
any requester for clarification of need . i completely understand that rac
typically has access to much sensitive information and they have a right to
know much information . we just want to make sure there is open flow of
information ( it is in everybody ' s best interests and the company ' s best
interests ) and that everybody is aware of how data is flowing .
best wishes ,
vasant
