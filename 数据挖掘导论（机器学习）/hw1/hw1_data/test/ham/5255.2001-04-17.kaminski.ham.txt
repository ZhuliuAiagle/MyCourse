kim ,
this is a letter from one of the job applicants who works for pros .
it seems that the system they develop for williams
is more a scheduling system .
would you like to ask him to come back for another interview ,
to get more information out of him ?
vince

dear vince :
it was so nice meeting and talking with you too . i did
not take any pen back , i lost my pen too somewhere in
enron .
as i mentioned to you , after i got my ph . d in 1999 , i
have been working two years as lead scientist and
science manager in energy division at pros revenue
management inc . in houston .
i developed and implemented the mathematical models
for trading optimization system and firm
transportation optimization system .
the trading optimization system becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year . duke energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday . conoco and williams also signed the
contracts for it . according to pros sales department ,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years .
enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management . i am
confident that i can make significant contributions to
enron in this area .
i would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to enron for this interview . i am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
enron .
sincerely yours
jacob
