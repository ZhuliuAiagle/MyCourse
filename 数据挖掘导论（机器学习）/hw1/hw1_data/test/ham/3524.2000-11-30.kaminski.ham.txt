Subject: re : project tracking database access
hi sandy :
yes he does . actually in our group meeting today , vince kaminski said
that he wants most of his group to have access . i believe stinson gibner
is working on the list . is there a way we could submit a request to
incorporate
a list of people to give them access ? they would need writing access also .
thanks !
