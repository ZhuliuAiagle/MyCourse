Subject: briefing robert johnston on metals
vince ,
sorry , i was not able to take your call this morning , to avoid distractions i
was editing a technical coner article on ppp out of my office . last friday ,
i called robert johnston immediately after you told me to contact him to
brief him on nonferrous metals . i let him know that i was scheduled to speak
about metals in our research meeting on october 12 th . i also talked with him
a few weeks ago that i would like to meet with him and scott tholan to brief
them on metals . robert did not arrange the meeting . i arranged a meeting
for 10 : 30 tomorrow to take them both through the metals fundametals speech .
the london metals confererence sounds great , since i have five years
experience in metals fundamental analysis and pricing , i would also like to
attend . many of my new research group customers are asking for my expertise
in this new business for enron . i could certainly help our customers better
by getting the latest information on metals . please let me know if this is
ok with you .
regards ,
maureen
