Subject: team rahal update
you asked me to look into this ( the ford sponsorship thing ) .
i think they will be unlikely to deliver on the benefits promised by m 3 management ( their marketing consultant ) and will add little value to our dealmaking opportunities with ford .
i will pass the info . along to ees to see if they have any interest in paying the $ 7 million for general advertising exposure .
