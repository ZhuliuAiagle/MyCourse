Subject: proposed promotions - netco
i worlked with jeff gosset , stacey white and bob hall today on their input for proposed promotions for operations . tana cashion has the recommended names and salary increases . do you need anything else ? description of their respoinsibilities , rationale for promotion recommendation , etc . ? let me know .
i mentioned to tana that letters had been given to both jeff gossett and bob superty in late november or december stating that they would be promoted from director to senior director at the first of the year . we have jeff covered , but with the change in bob superty ' s reporting relationship , i want to be certain that his promotion doesn ' t fall through the cracks . tana was somehow unaware of these letters , although they were prepared by hr . as you review the entire list of proposed promotions , please be check to make sure that bob superty ' s name was submitted by scott neal for a promotion .
thanks . - - sally
