hi david . this is the popup that we displayed until today :
enrononline is now available to our customers to transact only in order to provide a means to manage
enron credit exposure . while transactions may be available , customers entering into transactions
should carefully evaluate their positions and enron ' s current credit status before transacting .
by entering into a transaction , customers are agreeing that the foregoing shall supercede any
inconsistent representations made by enron in any agreements between enron and such customer .
