Subject: fw : netco benefit rate projections
john ,
the more i look at these comparisons , the more i ' m convinced we have to agree an interim subsidy to let folks down gently and / or a salary adjustment . i think we will lose a very high number of people from this transaction if we don ' t make some accommodation here .
i ' ll call you later today to discuss .
i also need to touch base with you on your salary comment . i need to clarify what you mean by salary freeze . i understood you were ok with us promoting a few people ( 50 or so ) in next 4 / 6 weeks ( so long as we run list passed you first ) and in this regard i would expect to adjust their salaries . we have traditionally raised commercial support salaries ( below vp ) in line with cola ( based on performance but typically around 3 - 4 . 5 % of payroll ) each january and there certainly will be some expectations we will have to deal with .
regards
david

i sent him back a reply saying , as a minimum , if we see " hardship " for the less than $ 100 k base people , we will want to raise their salaries 3 - 5 % .

we have this issue in every deal we do , the benefit coverage is good
overall , but employees pay more for the coverage . it ' s income based which
mitigates impact to lower paid and we find higher paid focus on total comp
and not benefits . benefits are the one thing we keep the same for all of
citigroup and we don ' t want to do anything with subsidy or anything else .
happy to discuss futher how we market overall comp . and ben . philosphy to
deal with the benefits .

john ,
i am worried about comparison between your and our benefits costs . perhaps
you could review and let me know if you agree we have a problem . my
recommendation is that we consider a subsidy or payrise for our people who
may otherwise suffer a hardship in meeting the additional costs of your
medical / dental premiums .

> your correct on the costs . i will be in a meeting most of the afternoon
today , but i should be able to have you a spreadsheet on monday showing some
different scenarios on how netco employees paychecks would be affected
paying for their own benefits based on their salary range and coverage tier

> i ' m not sure if i read this correctly but seems to me medical costs are
significantly higher under citi groups arrangements . i ' ve asked neil and
jeanie to work with you to illustrate if they are . i may need to get them to
subsidise for first 12 months the difference , if i can prove some hardship .

> david , below is an initial draft of our current benefit plans compared to
ssmb ' s plans . the main difference is employee ' s for ssmb pay for benefits
out of pocket instead of having flexdollars cover a portion of the cost .
