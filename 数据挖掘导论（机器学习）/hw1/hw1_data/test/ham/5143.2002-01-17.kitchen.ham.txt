Subject: launch issues
louise ,
1 ) has there been any resolution on whether we focus on marketing ubsenergy vs . ubswenergy ?
2 ) is our launch date confirmed for jan 29 ? ( did you find out the actual date of filing for hart - scott ? )
3 ) i am chasing the final , punctuation - correct name for the contracting party for gtc , eta and pa purposes , but as yet do not have a definitive answer .
4 ) i am also chasing articles of incorporation so we can proceed with the verisign application .
