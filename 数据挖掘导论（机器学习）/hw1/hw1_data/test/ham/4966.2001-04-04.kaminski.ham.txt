subject : support on statistical modeling
dear vince :
i was referred by rita hartfield of ebs . i am the director of marketing for
the digital content services team ( david cox , frank bay , et . al . ) . we are
identifying and evaluating features and functions that will be a part of the
next generation entertainment on demand ( eod ) product .
the e - mail i ' ve excerpted below contains two links to a company that offers a
" preferencing " service that we know is quite popular and important to
entertainment consumers . i have some questions abouts the statistics ,
sampling methodology , explained variance etc . of the model that the
stylelogic group employs .
do you have a member of your team that could assist on this project ?
thanks for your help ,
