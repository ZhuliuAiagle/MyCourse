subject : copy room
to whom it may concern :
i would like to know who will be responsible for keeping up with
the copy room near my area . eb 32 copy rooml
i am aware that this is something that must be decided by
whoever is in charge however , i would like to participate in keeping this
room operational .
please note that i use this room more often than anyone else
and i pay more attention to what is needed there on a daily basis .
i am not asking for full charge over the room but i would like to assist
whereby , it will always be operational .
thanks
