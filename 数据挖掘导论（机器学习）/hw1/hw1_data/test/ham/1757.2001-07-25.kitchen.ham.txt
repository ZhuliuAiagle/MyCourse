Subject: california update 7 / 25 / 01 p . 3
details are still rough and the situation is very fluid , but here is what is currently going on :
senators hertzberg and keeley are amending both sb 78 xx and ab 82 xx . upon an initial read , it appears that they are doing the following :
ab 82 xx has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio . ( the core / non - core business provisions , the transmission asset purchase , etc . all appear to have been deleted . ) both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated .
it appears amendments have been made to sb 78 xx but the extent of these changes are not yet known .
at the beginning of both amended bills , it states , " as proposed to be amended into sb _ xx . " this means that amendments to sb 78 could be incorporated into ab 82 , and vice versa . another possibility is an entirely new bill .
