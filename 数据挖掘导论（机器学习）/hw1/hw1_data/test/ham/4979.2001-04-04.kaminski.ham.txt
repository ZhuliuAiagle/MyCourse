tani nath who heads up the structuring and research teams rang this morning
to get more information on tony .
can you tell me who he reports to in houston and whether that person will
continue to manage him remotely ?
what cost centre he should be charged to ? whose headcount he appears on , and
for what group he will be providing services for , tani was unsure on all of
the above and wants clarification .
also can you confirm his start date in london
thanks

hi
tony is a uk employee who starts next monday 12 th march 2001 , we have done a
quick start in nest today for him .
tony will be working his first month in the houston office , however we still
need to set up a log on and notes account here .
can you please send the log on and password for both accounts to kevin as he
will be meeting with tony on monday morning in the houston office .
tony will not have a desk arranged for him until he comes back in
approximately a month so no actual pc is necessary until then .
one question - with a uk log on and notes account , will tony be able to
access these from houston ? if it ' s complicated can you please let kevin know
how to do this .
any problems let me know
thanks
desleigh
