Subject: re : so percopo
mostly a social call . brief discussion on noise in the market he ' s hearing and reading , etc . he walked me through oustanding issues on alamac that he is working with duran and heather to resolve . heather tells me there are only two remaining issues so i ' ll followup on those . i suggested rather than buying assets from us ( alamac ) , he should be ready for us to ask him to co - invest alongside us if we need equity partners in transactions ( bny , cogentrix , uae , etc - didn ' t discuss any particular deals ) . told him we ' d expect him to turn the deals quickly . he ' s ready and willing to be here any day we have something to discuss with him . i can fill you in on more details later . budget allocation from glisan has been postponed . i will let you know the outcome when its resolved .
