Subject: re : one last reminder and then i will be quiet
e - mail is perfect . it allows me to just dump your grades directly into our
database . i do then sign a hard copy ( indicating that i am signing in
proxy for you ) to hand over to the registrar . if you prefer , you could fax
the information as well ( 713 - 348 - 5251 ) . thank you for your help ! - pam
