dear dr . krishnarao ,
professor veinott told me a little about the research going on at enron
from his conversation with you late last week . the work sounded very
interesting to me . professor veinott also told me that the research group
at enron may have some positions for which i might be qualified . i am
writing to let you know that i would have great interest in exploring this
potential opportunity with you . to that end i attach my resume together
with an abstract of my ph . d . thesis under professor veinott as a word
document . i might also add that i expect to finish my ph . d . in management
science and engineering here by july 1 , 2001 .
incidentally , my work has led me to study your own thesis in some detail
and i have been very impressed with it . it may be of some interest to you
that our work is related and seems to require a different generalization
of karush ' s additivity - preservation theorem than the lovely ones you
develop .
i look forward to hearing from you .
sincerely ,
ningxiong xu
