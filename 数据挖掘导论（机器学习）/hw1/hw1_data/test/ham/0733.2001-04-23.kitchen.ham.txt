thank you for this revised version . i have signed this copy and request that a fully signed document is completed by tomorrow .
clearly the level of specification in this document is exceptionally high which may be the reason for the very extended timescales visible in this project . i would expect detailed documentation on each of the components of the projects in time which look at addressing the current timescales and shortening them .
thanks
louise
