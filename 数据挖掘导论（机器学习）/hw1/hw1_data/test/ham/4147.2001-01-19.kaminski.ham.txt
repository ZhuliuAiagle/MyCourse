hi , vince ,
this is li , writing from u . of chicago .
i am in the second quarter here .
the study and social life is extremely busy at the school .
but i enjoy connecting the knowledge i learn everyday here
with the experience i had with enron .
a schoolmate of mine , a chicago ph . d . candidate in finance ,
is looking for an internship for the coming summer .
i recommend him to write to you to see if you are interested in
or if there is a need . if so , you can contact with him directly .
he is a really bright guy . if not , hope you don ' t mind that
i sell enron at school so hard .
