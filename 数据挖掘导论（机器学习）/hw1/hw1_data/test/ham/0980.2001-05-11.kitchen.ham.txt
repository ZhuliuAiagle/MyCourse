we are receiving questions about your request . there is some confusion about what you want . is it that the teams need to be broken down differently ? is it a weekly thing as opposed to monthly ? each commercial team has a coordinator for p & l reporting and they prepare acctg reports as requested on behalf of the commercial lead . they will revise as you wish , we just need to know how you would like to change what you are getting . by the way , don ' t forget that there is somewhat detailed reporting of p & l in the monthly team report with detail of margin as well as expense breakdown into 20 types from comp and benefits to rent , depreciation , t dawson , brian

could you all add to your weekly reports a p / l statement breaking down your income to date this year . it is difficult to actually break down the numbers in the weekly p / l sheets delivered by wes ' s group . a break down on your weekly reports would be great .
please could you email all weekly reports to tammie schoppe on a friday ( and copy me ) and tammie will distribute to john . i have spent some time this week bringing john up to speed on everybody ' s areas and what you each have going on .
tammie has all of my contact numbers and will be in contact with me . i am sure i will be back in contact in the next few weeks and i will be picking up email after i initially come to terms with the lack of sleep etc .
take care
