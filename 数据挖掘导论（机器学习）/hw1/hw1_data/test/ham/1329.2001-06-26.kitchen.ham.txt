Subject: ews otc discussions on individual bu md and vp relative
contributions for first 6 months of 2001
greg has asked if i would help arrange 1 hour individual meetings with the otc of each ews bu to discuss the relative performance of each of your commercial md ' s and vp ' s so far this year . the intent is to give greg a general understanding of how you would rate your md and vp slates on a continuum of top through bottom ( i . e . ignoring the prc 1 thru 5 scale but instead listing number 1 thru number 10 if you have 10 vp ' s ) .
in recognising that this may seem like an additional burden over and above the various prc discussion we have already committed to , i would encourage you to avoid spending any significant time in preparing for this discussion , aside from ensuring you have a complete picture of all your commercial vp ' s and md ' s and then listing them down quickly as above .
i will call your respective hr leads and ask them to help by providing you with the initial slate . i believe liz will call to arrange a convenient time for you to meet with greg at some point before the end of next week .
