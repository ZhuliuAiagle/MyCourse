" reasonable " works for me - my interpretation is what enron has done in the past ( and many other companies do ) including but not limited to the following :
- actual moving and related costs
- sales commission on house
- a couple of moving trips
- temp housing for a month or two
- coverage on appraised value of house if can not sell quickly
- gross up to cover taxes , where appropriate
- not looking to gain , just to remain whole

ummm . don ' t see an issue with expenses , although i ' m sure purchaser will have arrangements with their own shipping company etc . , everyone i ' ve spoken too has a domestic relo program and citi in particular have agreed to meet any obligations we have previously made so long as we tell them now .
i ' ll see what else i can find out . only thing i ' d add to chris ' s note is an agreement that he will move to houston if we meet all " reasonable " costs .

chris will obviously be relocating to houston in the near future . we need to make sure we cover all of the expenses . how do you intend to do this under the proposed contract ?
