john ,
after reviewing the p & l from 09 / 04 , anne bike discovered that she allocated the cumulative transport model loss for 09 / 04 , when she should have simply allocated the change for the day . the change for the day was a positive 657 , 000 and the cumulative for the month was a negative 4 , 058 , 586 . the correction will be made today for a positive 4 , 716 , 388 .
thanks ,
mike
