Subject: light switch for eb 1939
good morning all :
maureen raymond castaneda is officed in ebl 939 . she has terrible migraine
headaches which are made worse by light . we would like to get a price on
having an on / off switch installed in her room . as of now , they have removed
the light bulbs , but said that may not completely answer the problem as some
one may see that they are out and request they be replaced .
i think the answer ( if it is not too expensive ) would be to have a switch
installed .
please let me know .
our co . # is 0011 and our rc # is 100038 .
thanks !
shirley
