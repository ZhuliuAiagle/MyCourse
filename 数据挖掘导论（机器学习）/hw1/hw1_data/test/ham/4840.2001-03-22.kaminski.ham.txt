abstract
" i provide evidence that nasdaq dealers make markets in the stocks in which
they receive order flow . several variables used to proxy for the stocks
that individual market maker ' s brokerage customers would trade , including
trading volume , location , underwriting participation and analyst coverage ,
are significant determinants of market marking activity . informational
advantages may also be a factor in the market making decision as evidenced
by dealers specializing in stocks in specific industries . some potential
problems that arise when researchers ignore the integration of market
making with brokerage , securities analysis and underwriting businesses are
discussed . "
