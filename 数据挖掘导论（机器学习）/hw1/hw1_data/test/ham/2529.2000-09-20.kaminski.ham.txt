subject : university of texas conference on energy finance , february 2001
jeff ,
our friends at the university of texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in february of next year . they would like very much to
have
you as a keynote speaker .
given our good , long - term relationship with ut , i would recommend
that you speak at this conference . i talked to prof . ehud ronn
a few times about the program and i think that this will be
an excellent forum to present enron ' s accomplishments and
agenda for the future .
i am sure that rick causey will join me in making the same recommendation .
vince
