vince ,
i ran across this during my recruiting at vanderbilt . it is headed by hans
stoll , one of the leading derivative academicians in the country . i looked
at their website briefly and thought you might be interested . i have also
forwarded some email correspondence between dr . stoll and joe gordon , one of
our associates and a former student of his at owen school . we have been very
successful lately in recruiting at vanderbilt , both at the undergrad and mba
levels , and have gotten some high quality people . please let me know if you
have any interest in this and i would be glad to follow up with dr . stoll or
help out in any way i can .
thank you ,
mark courtney

joe ,
thanks for your note .
the purpose of the fmrc is to stimulate research on financial markets and to
provide a link between academic research , real world issues and regulation .
members of the center sit on the advisory board and help direct the research
of the center . they send an unlimited number of participants to center
conferences . our center is unique in its mix of academics , practitioners and
regulators . for members , such as enron , it provides a window on the academic
world , and would give enron an opportunity to stimulate research in the use
of markets in heretofore unusual commodities .
more information on the center can be found at
http : / / mba . vanderbilt . edu / fmrc /
center members include , nyse , nasdaq , cme , some high tech trading firms ,
merrill lynch . . . .
joining the center usually requires a top management decision , but i would
approach it through the research and the trading areas . one way to start is
to see if anyone in a position to recommend joining the center would like to
attend this year ' s conference on april 13 - 14 . the program is on the web
site . ( membership is $ 10 , 000 per year )
appreciate your interest and help .
let me know if we should provide more detail to someone .
regards ,
hans

dr . stoll :
sorry for the delay , but we haven ' t forgotten about your interest in having
enron participate in the fmrc . our holdup is determining who is the
appropriate contact person at enron ( that , and neglect ) . we ' re not sure if
we should approach someone from trading , research , senior management , etc .
also , any additional information on the role the participating firms play
would be helpful .
thanks ,
joe gordon
