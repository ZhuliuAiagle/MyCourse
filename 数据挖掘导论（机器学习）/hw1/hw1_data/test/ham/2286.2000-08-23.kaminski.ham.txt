norma ,
thanks for your excellent suggestion of using a retention bonus for martin
lin in order to address both the issues of compensation and retention for
him . as i mentioned during our meeting , just my small team within research
has lost 3 people over about the last 2 years , and we have had a hard time
recruiting good candidates . last year we made an offer to a person
graduating from ut ( ms in computational finance ) of 75 k plus 25 k signing
bonus . he replied that he would like to work at enron but was already in
the position of turning down an offer with a base salary above $ 100 k .
martin is a very skilled individual with a ph . d . in electrical engineering
and almost two years experience at enron . he would be very difficult ( and
expensive ) to replace . for this reason i feel it necessary to be proactive
in finding ways of retaining him as an employee .
please let me know if we have a green light to go forward with a 1 - year
retention bonus of 10 k and a raise to 87 k base salary for mr . lin . i would
plan to then give martin an additional raise at his next review period .
regards ,
stinson
