subject : howard haughton : no can do for wed / thurs .
hi rachel . please read the following email from my collegue in the uk who
spoke directly to howard a bit ago by tele about wed / thurs interview .
can we do this alternative he suggested ? we will have to reschedule - maybe
ny ? or after howards trip in houston ?
thanks ,
jeff

10 th of feb . either enron could fly him to houston after his holiday or
maybe vince ' s team could get out to new york . let me know .
