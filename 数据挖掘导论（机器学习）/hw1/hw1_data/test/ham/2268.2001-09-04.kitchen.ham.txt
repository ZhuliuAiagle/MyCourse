Subject: london question .
greg mentioned today that you had asked about paul goddard and his continuing interest in canada . i ' ve been offering paul the chance to do much more outward - facing commercial work digging into things like huberator and powerits ( from this morning ' s articles ) as well as any potential sales of our platform technology in europe . he expresses keen interest , but his heart seems to be in canada . he has committed to come to some career conclusions within the next week or two .
we ' ve also been speaking with heather kendall , a director who works for gary hickerson in london helping to roll - up the ag business . i ' ve worked with her before , and she would be great for enrononline ' s efforts at gaining traction in new products , marketing and origination out of london . her issue is wanting to come back to houston at some point . i suppose i need your help in 2 ways . first , if you know heather and are comfortable nudging her toward our shop , i think it would go a long way . second , if you are familiar with anyone else in london with deep enron background and broad commercial shoulders who ' s looking for an open lane , we need to talk to them . clearly paul and lara are doing a great job , but we need even more firepower over there to iron out some of the issues the desks are facing , both internally and externally .
thanks in advance for any help you can offer ,
brad
