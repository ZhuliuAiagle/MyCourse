Subject: vitro
brian ,
it looks like we should be able to cover vitro with the people in virgo ' s group . robert rimbau is currently very involved , and can stay involved and we can bring dave kristich if needed .
as we discussed , pursuant to the terms of the transition services agreement , we need to contact tractebel as soon as anyone listed on the schedule is unavailable . do you have the contact info for tractebel ?
thanks ,
don
