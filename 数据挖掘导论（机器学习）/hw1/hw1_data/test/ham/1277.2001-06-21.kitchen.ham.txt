we can definitely show them a firm , fixed price bid at sp - 15 . they should be able to deliver into sp - 15 . the issue is that we require huge credit for market ld ' s . duffy told laura and stew rosman that the plant would have some free optionality from cfe so we thought that a services approach made sense .
our unit contingent fixed - price bid would be haircuted so much that it would not get done .
laura and stewart are prepared to show fixed - price term bids if that ' s what they want but i suspect that we will have a big credit / transfer price discussion - ultimately someone has to pay for the market ld ' s .

don ' t know whether you have heard of the mexico plant at fapsa ' s paper company . potentially the project would need to export 10 - 15 mw to you guys to make it viable . i know they have been talking to laura wente in your group and got feedback that the best you can do is reasonable endeavours .
is this at all viable on a firmer basis or viable at all ?
thanks
