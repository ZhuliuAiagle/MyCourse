" the
biggest financial bubble in history "
in the article " after the
fall , " in the june 16 , 2005 issue of economist magazine , real estate was called ,
" the biggest financial bubble in history . " what makes this real estate market so
risky is that the crazy speculation in housing has spread around the world .
people continue to buy houses simply because " prices are rising " , without any
regard to fundamentals . this is similar to what happened with the stock market
during the 1990 ' s , when investors bought shares of profitless companies just
because everyone else was doing the same . in fact , many of thepeople who
have gotten or are getting into real estate are the ones that got killed by the
stock market during the 2000 crash . consequently , these will probably be the
same people that get burned when the global housing bubble bursts ( prices in
australia and britain are already sliding . america ' s housing market may be a
year or so behind ) .

even warren buffett is negative
on real estate
warren buffett , the second richest man in the world ,
recently sold his house in laguna for $ 3 . 5 million . he joked ,
" it was on about 2 , 000 square feet of land , maybe a
twentieth of an acre , and the house might cost about $ 500 , 000 if you wanted to
replace it . so the land sold for something like $ 60 million an acre . " [ if you
want to read more about this , you can go to cnn ' s website at http : / / money . cnn . com / 2005 / 05 / 01 / news / fortune 500 / buffett _ talks / ]

ready to burst ?
and why is buffett betting against the us dollar ? [ note :
buffett made $ 1 . 63 billion in foreign currency ( fx ) gains from the dollar ? s
decline in the last quarter of 2004 ]
