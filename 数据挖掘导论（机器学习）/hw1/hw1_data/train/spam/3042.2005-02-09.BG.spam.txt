mark at 27 months looked ? normal ? . he came from a good family who provided lots of stimulation . mark had one word - - ' ba ' as in ' ball . ' everything was ' ba .

brian was a boy with down ' s syndrome . he was taking several medications . brian came from a nurturing family and extended family who provided him with every opportunity . his mother was a teacher and wanted what was best for him . he exhibited no language and was considerably behind his other friends with down ? s syndrome . we set up a noun program at school . at first he seemed disinterested . he looked at the pictures and sucked his thumb . the more we encouraged him to engage the keyboard , the more he sucked his thumb . we then paired him with a child who was very interested in the noun program . suddenly the two were fighting over who was next to pick a picture . he worked several times a week at the computer . at his 3 - year iep , the team shook their heads . they didn ' t understand . despite the track record of many students with down ? s syndrome , brian ' s language was his best skill . i smiled and his mother winked at me .
we are discreet sheep ; we wait to see how the drove is going , and then go with the drove . - mark twain [ samuel langhornne clemens ] ( 1835 - 1910 )
