they be today ? today we will be introducing a new football alumni
association that will bring ex high school , college , and

their glory days .
as savvy
investor prepare to buy this stock , it has become clear that this
could be one of the most explosive opportunities of the year . you
still have the opportunity to buy this stock for pennies to the
dollar - but for how long ?
here at wall
street research we do not get excited about many stocks . that ' s
because its getting harder and harder to find stocks that have
potential to make investors rich very quickly . blue
chips can ' t and ipo ' s rarely pay off small
investors . history shows that the only consistent way for small
investors to see their money double , triple , or more on the
short run is to be smart enough to find small caps with huge
potential and buy before they take off - the kind of stocks that
gets us excited .

sports alumni , inc maybe you started playing football when you where
8 years old and never quite lost the love of the game . perhaps you
even played college ball . what ever level you played , its a good bet
that your passion for the game did not end when the whistle blew and
the last play ended . that is what american football alumni seeks to
bring back to the multi - million - member target market of former and
current players and coaches .
recent surveys reveal that 70 percent of former football players would
be interested in joining a national alumni association whose makeup is
former high school and college players . seventy - nine percent are
interested in reunions with former teammates and 55 percent said
they ' d be interested in purchasing their old school football jerseys ,
especially if their names were included .
the afa will bring old teams together through its subscriber network ,
while offering on line stores of customized merchandise , a first class
magazine , conventions , football travel packages national and local
polls . this is an un - tapped industry within a multi - billion dollar
marketplace .
