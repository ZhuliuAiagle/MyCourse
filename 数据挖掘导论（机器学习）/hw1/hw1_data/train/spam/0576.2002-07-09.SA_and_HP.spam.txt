understanding hipaa
the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996
( public law 104 - 191 ) ,
also known as hipaa , was enacted as part of a broad congressional
attempt at incremental healthcare reform . part of the law requires
the us dept . of health and human services ( dhhs ) to develop standards
and requirements for maintenance and transmission of health information
that identifies individual patients . the requirements outlined by
the law are far - reaching for all healthcare organizations that maintain
or transmit electronic health information must comply . “ ibxg ”
offers all health care providers with a viable , already in place
solution to “ hipaa ” compliance .
