flexible reliable force
sensors - flexiforce .
the flexiforce
a 201 force sensor is an ultra - thin , flexible printed circuit . the force
sensors are constructed of two layers of substrate ( polyester / polyimide )
film . on each layer , a conductive material ( silver ) is applied , followed
by a layer of pressure - sensitive ink . adhesive is then used to laminate
the two layers of substrate together to form the force sensor . the active
sensing area is defined by the silver circle on top of the
pressure - sensitive ink . silver extends from the sensing area to the
connectors at the other end of the sensor , forming the conductive leads .
a 201 sensors are terminated with male square pins , allowing them to be
easily incorporated into a circuit . the two outer pins of the connector
are active and the center pin is inactive .
