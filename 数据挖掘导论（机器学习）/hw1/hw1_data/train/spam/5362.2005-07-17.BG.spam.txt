corrupted message
this is the courier mail server 0 . 47 on hrwl . com . cn .
i received the following message for delivery to your address . this message
contains several internal formatting errors . this is often caused by
viruses that attempt to infect remote systems . instead of blocking
this message , it has been converted as a safe , text - only attachment that
can be safely read with a text editor .
this sometimes also happens when the sender ' s mail software has a bug
that creates improperly - formatted messages . although these kinds of
formatting errors may often be ignored by other mail servers , this
server detects and intercepts improperly - coded messages in order to
prevent viruses from taking advantage of bugs in e - mail programs :
the headers in this message contain improperly - formatted binary content .
see for more information .
