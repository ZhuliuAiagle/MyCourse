Subject: wall street ' s dirty little secret . . .
it was the spring of 1979 .
i was just a tall , goofy looking kid in middle school
with buck - teeth and freckles . each day in the
cafeteria , i walked from table to table . . .
stealing other kids ' lunch money .
no , i didn ' t rob them with a gun or a knife - i just made
them a little deal . " let me borrow two dollars today , " i said ,
" and i ' ll bring you five dollars next week . " the investment
was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their
lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course
when " next week " rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash ,
i promised to pay them even more the week after that ,
if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit
longer .
eventually the end of the year came and went , high school
started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties ,
and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more
things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money .
i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid ,
and i didn ' t even get beat up .
hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market
secrets you will ever learn .
first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not
going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when
you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before
grabbing the lifejacket .
second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind .
they are looking out for their own money , not yours .
the " professionals " , those stuffy investment counselors and
money managers , will always tell you that the best time to
buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep
your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make .
ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is
" never " .
in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index
fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars
in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem :
do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ?
hell no !
you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to
make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old
in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in
the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would
you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ?
the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich .
if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility
is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see
those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed
by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t
care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long
it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the
money .
what i ' m talking about here is day trading .
my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks
and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years
he makes money .
the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a
$ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking
advantage of all the information at his disposal about a
certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or
down within hours , sometimes within minutes .
i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing
amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you
only need to learn a few basic principles to get started .
society would have you believe that successful trading is
complicated and requires formal training .
the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment
strategies to make money .
popular media and investment professionals portray successful
trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing
ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell
don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm
to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty
dollars .
they make their money only if you believe two lies :
1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average
person .
2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high
commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks
per trade .
here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely ,
positively do not want you to know . . .
