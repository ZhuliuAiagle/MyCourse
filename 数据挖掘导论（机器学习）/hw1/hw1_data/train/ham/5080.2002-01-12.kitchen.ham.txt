hi louise ,
just thought you should know . . .
we ' ve kept the mixed estate / netco application development teams bound together for these migration efforts and its just remarkable how hard these people are working . most of the dba team , headed by mable tang ( oracle ) and charles brewer ( sql server ) have been putting in very long hours and last night most didn ' t go home ! ( really ) . the livelink team were here untill the small hours too .
the infrastructure server people in particular ( charles ballmer and michael barber ) and their team members have worked very hard over the last week , getting ready .
they are all set to pull off the netco migration during the latter part of next week and through the weekend , and everyone seems to be very confident that we ' ll pull it off .
i ' d like to make special mention of one young lady called jane henry ( just a specialist ! ) who has more front than sainsbury ' s ( can ' t explain that to an american ! ) , who has been acting as anchor and project co - ordinator for all the activities and working long nights . she manages to keep control of all those strong personalities and kept us all on track . i ' d be very gratefull if you could find time to drop her a quick line . . . . she ' d be impressed at the recognition . . . .
regards
steve
