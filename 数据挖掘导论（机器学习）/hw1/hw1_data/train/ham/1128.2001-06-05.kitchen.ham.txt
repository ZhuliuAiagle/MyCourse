i will be taking over the weekly hotlist from marlene cameron and will be sending the weekly updates vis e - mail . rob milnthorp has requested that the following change be made to the weekly management summary report ( 2 nd qtr . 2001 earnings estimate ) :
eliminate the retail ( milnthorp ) line and shift the balances into the executive ( milnthorp ) lines .
can you respond to me via e - mail once the above request has been addressed ?
thank you
grant
