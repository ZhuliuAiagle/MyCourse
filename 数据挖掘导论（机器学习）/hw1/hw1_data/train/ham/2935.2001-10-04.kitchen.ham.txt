if you are on this distribution you have been identified by john and louise as the responsible party for signing off on the ecs 6 th floor . your assistants and other key people have done a great job of managing the floor plans so far and we ' re on the home stretch . john made some group location changes today and a final review / update is required before churns are submitted this week .
please take a moment to review the locations of your people and place them in the appropriate seats within your group ( best printed on 11 x 17 paper ) note that desks 858 - 860 , 651 - 652 , 658 - 660 , 662 - 667 and 705 - 715 will not be available on day 1 , temporary replacement seats are assigned in the lower right hand of the spread sheet , if the lag time will be over two weeks .
kindly return this at your earliest convenience on thursday , confirming your approval of the names and seat assignments . i am also including the most current version of the 5 th floor for your information .
