Subject: residual values - cogentrix
louise ,
i spoke with victor yesterday and he said that the numbers we saw in our cogentrix meeting reflect our standard qf valuation methodology including a residual value of $ 250 kw , grown at 2 . 5 % until the end of the contracted period . i had him do a sensitivity analysis by dropping the value to $ 100 kw and it only had a $ 50 million impact .
let me know if you have any additional thoughts .
