subject : jeff skilling does msl 50
well , the bike is inspected , a few training rides have been made , and the
camping gear is being dusted off ( yes , he is actually camping at the
fairgrounds in lagrange ! ) . now all our fearless leader ( and incidentally ,
the national multiple sclerosis society ' s 2000 man of the year ) , jeff
skilling , needs is your help in raising money for ms .
enron ' s msl 50 dream team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over
350 enron employees , led by jeff , will ride from houston to austin under the
enron flag april 15 - 16 , and the team ' s goal is to raise $ 350 , 000 . i am
challenging ( is begging a better word ? ) each of you to pledge a certain
amount per mile - i . e . , $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 5 , it ' s your call . i ' ll even give you a
break on the calculation and use 150 miles , even though jeff swears it ' s
closer to 170 miles ( you know how he is with numbers ) . of course , a flat
pledge is also appreciated . and don ' t forget , enron will match your pledge
to this very worthy cause 1 - 1 .
i hope you will join the team and help enron maintain its status as the top
money raiser of all msl 50 rides in the nation ! thank you for your
consideration . if you have any questions , please don ' t hesitate to call me .
