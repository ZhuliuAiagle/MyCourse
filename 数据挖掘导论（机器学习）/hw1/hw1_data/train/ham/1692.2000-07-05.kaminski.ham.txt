can you guys followup with him to coordinate an enron reception following a
presentation that vince kaminiski will give during their annual ut
foundations of energy finance class . we do want to do this , and of course
need to coordinate with vince and your dates on campus to ensure that we have
no conflicts .
i am not sure if this falls into the associate or analyst camp . you can best
determine who the appropriate contact should be . leave me an e - mail to
confirm .

celeste ,
greetings .
as you may recall , i am the director of the univ . of texas center for
energy finance ( cefer ) . i would like at this time to initiate planning for
your colleague vince kaminski ' s annual presentation to the ut foundations
of energy finance class which i will be presenting as usual the first half
of the fall semester .
thus , to begin , i wonder whether either the above is your current e - mail
account , and , with the departure of meryl barnett ( with whom i believe we
coordinated this in the past ) , whether this is an issue within your scope .
with respect to this reception , i appreciate that there may be other enron
receptions scheduled for this fall . however , if you so choose , i would
like to afford you the opportunity of scheduling an enron reception
following vince ' s presentation . if you would indeed like to do so , i
suggest we coordinate with vince the date for the presentation / reception .
sincerely ,
ehud
