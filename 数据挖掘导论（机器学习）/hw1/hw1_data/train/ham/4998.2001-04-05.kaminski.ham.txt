subject : re : hi !
good to hear from you . things are going pretty well hear , but busy with the
end of the semester coming up .
as for u of h , i guess there are several possibilities depending on what
shane wants to do . the best researcher in their group by far , in my
opinion , is bong - soo lee . but he does more general asset pricing stuff .
minnesota econ phd , really smart . their main derivatives guy is rabon
rabinovich . he ' s done some good work in the past but not very active in the
last five or ten years . or , you could go with ron singer or art warga
( art ' s more respected and more active ) . these guys are more senior , more
general , and do more research than ramon - - i would guess that they tend to
be the workhorses in terms of advising phd students at u of h .
in any case , please destroy this info as soon as you digest it . i would
hate for my candidate assessments to ever get passed along to the good folks
at u of h .
