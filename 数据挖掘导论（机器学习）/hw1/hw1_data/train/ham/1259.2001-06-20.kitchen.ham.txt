Subject: enron harvard cases
friends . . .
chris bartlett at harvard presented ( last week ) the 2 most recent enron cases he wrote to the " harvard program for global leadership " . this is an exec ed program for cxo ' s and senior management from throughout the world . chris called me today to say that the cases received outstanding reviews , and that the largely international cxo audience was both knowledgeable about , and very ' pro - enron ' !
best !
