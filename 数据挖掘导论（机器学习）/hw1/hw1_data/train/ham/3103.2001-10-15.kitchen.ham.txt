this sounds like to same offering that we previously received about two weeks ago from michael kolman ( not our michael coleman ) of navigant . was the offering you received from navigant as well ?
fyi , navigant ( again , michael kolman ) is representing us on the sale of our sw 501 d 5 a , and we have frequent updates with him on our turbine as well as other turbines and sites being offered in the market .
regards ,
ben
