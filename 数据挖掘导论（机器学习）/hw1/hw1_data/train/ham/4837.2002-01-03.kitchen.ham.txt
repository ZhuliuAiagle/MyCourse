Subject: re : list of topn 50 counterparties
thanks . will talk with you tomorrow . one issue that should be discussed is
the timeline that you sent to scott flood earlier today . my guess is that
any bidder will have their own minimum master and contract wording that they
will want to use as well as credit department needs . and so sending out
language to counterparties before a bidder is awarded should be carefully
thought out because it may not be acceptable to the bidder . this is only a
timing issue i think but is important nonetheless .
