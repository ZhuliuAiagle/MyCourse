Subject: houston research opportunity
hi vince ,
thank you for offering the opportunity in houston to me last week . i guess i
would interested to discuss it further with you - one question i have is
about which commercial groups within the houston office you were looking for
additional research coverage on ? please let me know when you might be free
to talk - the best times for me would be from between 12 pm and 5 pm houston
time ( i am usually home from 3 pm houston time ) .
regards ,
