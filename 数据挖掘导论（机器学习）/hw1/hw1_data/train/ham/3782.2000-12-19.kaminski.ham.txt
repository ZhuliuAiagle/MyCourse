vince :
i was confused also - but i think this is the computer we ordered for
the new employee that is coming next week ( rakesh bharati ) . phillip our
it floor tech said that the computer in the back room at ebl 972 g was very
old and did not have much memory so i ordered a new one with an
upgrade to bring it up to 196 m ( this is what phillip said we need ) . also
there
is another computer back there that does not have much memory and we
ordered an upgrade for it ( jason ' s ) . i went ahead an did it so that they
would
be ready when the new employees come in .
maureen already has her upgrade .
