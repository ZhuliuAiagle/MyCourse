vince ,
i hope things are well with you and your family .
the reason for contacting you today is to let you know i will be in houston
next
week between monday and wednesday inclusive . if there is an opportunity to
meet
up , probably informally , it would be useful to discuss our continuing
activities
in the areas of strategy , value and , increasingly , real options .
if you are attending our energy symposium , or can meet up , please contact me
at
your convenience . if we do meet , i would also like to introduce you to one of
our senior managers from houston : george e . danner . george is a member of
our
us national strategy team and part of our global network of specialists
working
on real option pricing .
if i do not speak to you before tomorrow - happy thanksgiving .
allan
