subject : re - cap of branding decisions
all
in order to be clear about all the discussions that have taken place
on
the brand issues i ' ve been asked to summarise the final decisions :
1 . website : the url is www . ubswenergy . com
2 . e - mail address : firstname . lastname @ ubswenergy . com
3 . company marketing name : ubs warburg energy
4 . company legal entity name : ubs warburg energy llc
the first three are to be reviewed after approximately 6 months .
notes :
1 . when referring to the new company in text , the website should
always
be referred to as ' ubswenergy . com ' and not just ubswenergy - case can
be either upper or lower
2 . the corporate identity rules of ubs warburg are to be followed
when
producing any company material either for internal or external use .
the above was agreed with heidi baumann , pat o ' donnell and john
costas .
