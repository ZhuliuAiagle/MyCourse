kal , please provide david with as many statistics as he needs for his book .
could you also make sure that david gets help in turning around any
comments on any quotes etc he may want to use for his book as i understand
they have some pretty short timescales .
i have attached a couple of recent presentations and the old presentation
from the analyst conference in january .
( see attached file : extendedeol . ppt )
thanks
louise
