Subject: mhi engines , relationship
bob and wayne ,
it appears that our commercial group is discussing whether to suspend payments on the mhi engines claiming force majeure , basing this on the recent terrorist activity . is this a path we want to follow , and is this supported by enron management ?
i ' m quite concerned that this will only lead to more confusion , high legal costs , and difficulty with disposing of these assets , similar to the problems that have been created with the westinghouse d 5 a .
if this is supported by upper management , i would like to know so i am prepared to deal with the results of the situation .
thanks !
mike
