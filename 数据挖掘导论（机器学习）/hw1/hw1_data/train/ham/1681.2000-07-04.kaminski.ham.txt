hi richard ,
lloyd fleming introduced me to the key personnel on the trading and risk side
at mg today ; i spent most of today discussing forward curves and option
volatilities with tim jones , russell plackett and jon barrett . i hope to be
able to get historical data from david thompson to facilitate forward curve
analysis for our var models . also discussed valuation issues ( e . g . option on
calendar spread that they need a model for ) . also was able to get a good
understanding of trading strategies and nuances of aluminum , copper and
nickel markets .
regards ,
