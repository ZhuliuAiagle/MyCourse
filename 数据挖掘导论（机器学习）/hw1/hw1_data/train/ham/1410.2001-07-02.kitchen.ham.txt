guy ,
your intent for the conference calls was right . we need to have a dialog with these parties like we do with the rest of our structured suppliers . but it must be a coordinated effort . there was no need to cancel the calls . please coordinate to reestablish the conference calls with these contacts and for any others you may have , please contact the following people as they are directly responsible for customer coverage and structured supply in their respective regions . we appreciate your efforts and like comed and aep , i am sure we will continue to work closely .
