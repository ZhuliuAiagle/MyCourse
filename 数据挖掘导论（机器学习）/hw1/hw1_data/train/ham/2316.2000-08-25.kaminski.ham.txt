Subject: re : henwood query
good talking with you this morning . by all means , talk to grant masson about
who else is using the henwood model within enron .
attached are the workbooks i mentioned . the " details of jan and july . xls "
workbook contains the resulting listing from the query i gave you yesterday
and you can see how the supply curve was created from that . the supply curve
becomes nonsense at points for reasons i believe are related to reliability
commitment constrants , instead of pure economic dispatch , and to the aggregate
reporting problem i described in my note yesterday .
the workbook " supply curve . xls " has the simplistic , average supply curve i
mentioned , constructed from fuel and vom costs . depending on the question you
are trying to answer , it may be an approach to consider .
the henwood contacts i had in mind are :
tao guo , phd , senior " algorithmist " ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) * the one i was thinking
of
wenxiong huang , phd senior project consultant ( 916 - 569 - 0985 )
ajit kulkarni , phd , software product manager ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) * more a trainer ,
but sharp
cosimo coscia , senior consultant ( south australia ) 618 - 8357 - 1244 * very
resourceful
wade schauer , staff consultant , ( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) * best for questions about emss
per se
all have emails , of course . template : tguo @ hesinet . com
also , if you can not get satisfaction , contact eric toolson , vp
( 916 - 569 - 0985 ) . he has a laconic style , but is very focused on customer
satisfaction and retention . and he has the pull to make things happen .
regards ,
michael

michael ,
i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i am
currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and
consequently the person to contact in case of problems .
i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide
the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the
numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and
system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each
station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea
marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations
according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station
detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :
for each hour , for each generating station :
" marginal cost " [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -
vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]
this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a marginal
station which i get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a
station given in marginal station field in transarea marginal units query . i
have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and transarea _ data table but non
of the costs there match my results .
do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which
outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?
it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case
could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .
regards
karolina
