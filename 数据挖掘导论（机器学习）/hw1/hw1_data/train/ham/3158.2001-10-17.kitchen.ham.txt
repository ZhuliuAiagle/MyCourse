subject : cordillera update
i spoke with tad herz today . tad stated that cordillera is waiting on one other proposal . however , tad informed me that enron ' s bid was currently in first place . cordillera should make a decision within a week . any suggestions or ideas to possibly influence cordillera decision .
thanks . . . kevin
