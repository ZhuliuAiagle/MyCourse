the access requested is : o : \ research \ power meteorology \ weather temperatures -

data approval grant
this is what i wrote , denying the request :
the reason for the rejection has been communicated several times .
the person who requested the access does not want it any more . granting both
read / write access could threaten the integrity of the data .
any comments ?
