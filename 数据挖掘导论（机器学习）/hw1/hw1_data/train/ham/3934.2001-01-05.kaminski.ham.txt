Subject: vince / stinson ,
please find the two attachments that give a more detailed calculation , as
well as the revised statement that can be made to press .
the numbers are not small , but really do not reflect the true magnitude of
the genset issue . they do not take into account the capital costs of the
gensets , and also do not focus on the many smaller units that are operating
in homes , and commercial establishments .
hope ths helps .
regards ,
sandeep .
