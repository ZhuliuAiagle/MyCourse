Subject: dispatch within maharashtra
jim ,
please find attached some slides that show the results of the henwood run
giving dispatch for the dabhol plant within maharashtra . i have also sent
the presentation we made to you to wade . he is to get back on when would be
an appropriate time for him to go over the presentation with me .
vince , stinson and i have placed ourselves on rebecca ' s calender for friday ,
and we will make the complete pitch to her . it would be great if you too
could be present at the meeting . if it is possible , please do let me know .
on the attached slides , please note that :
the slides all assume that there is a 1 part power tariff , mseb liability for
the entire capacity payment is not considered .
the henwood model was with no power flowing out of maharashtra
when variable o & m costs , fixed o though in
some months ( jan ) it goes as high as $ 69 mm . hence , overall , mseb can pay
for the dispatches as shown in the henwood run provided , they are not paying
for the capacity payment for the whole 2184 mw plant .
in conclusion , therefore , mseb has the need for between 1200 to 410 mw on a
seasonal basis . this means that the power remaining to be sold to other
states is the difference between that and 2184 mw .
however , since the demand within maharashtra varies seasonally , it may mean
that we need to market seasonal products to other states , not long term
blocks .
these are our conclusions . we may continue to work some more on the fuel and
hedging side . if you have any more questions for me , please let me know ,
else for now there will not be any new henwood runs .
regards ,
sandeep .
