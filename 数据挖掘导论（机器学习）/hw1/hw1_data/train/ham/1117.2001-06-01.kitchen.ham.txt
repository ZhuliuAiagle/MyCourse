line company from enron
thanks for the note . i opposed the numbers issue , as well . aep is adamant about them being in there and whalley , redmond , and colwell were fine with it .
first of all , congratulations . i was afraid you were going to have your baby in the office . my wife and i are getting some sleep , but as i ' m sure you ' re experiencing , it comes in short doses . i hope all is well for you . thanks for the flowers . they were incredible !
