notes
? portcalc changes for gas daily and cpr deals have been taking longer than originally estimated due to new items and complexities uncovered during development .
? the user acceptance test for cash position in tds has been held up by the portcalc changes .
? for phase 1 single point of deal entry for term deals , the user acceptance test uncovered some additional work needed . the team has been working closely with geof , chuck , russ and george to provide the needed functionalities .
? the user has been testing the changes for gas daily options ( phase 2 ) for the last few weeks . it development was completed a few weeks ago . no new changes have been requested .
