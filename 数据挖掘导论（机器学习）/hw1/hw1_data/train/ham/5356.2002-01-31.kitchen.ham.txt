Subject: victory and setbacks
victory
we have a definitive statement from ubs that we can brand our product as ubswenergy ( ok , so the " w " still sucks , but i ' m looking on the bright side ) .
setback
we still have not started marketing to our top 50 , due to a ) not having phone numbers for connecticut until about 4 : 00 today and ( b ) not having an approved cover letter from legal ( it turns out everyone thought someone else was doing it - despite repeated calls chasing this up ) .
plan
as of minutes ago , i have a lou eber approved cover letter , which lou specified requires approval from mark taylor and claudia robinson . i assume i will have these approvals by morning and will start marketing then .
