Subject: test project proposal
vince :
i did get the proposal out today , but after close of business your time .
sorry for the brief delay . you will find two attachments . the first is our
time and materials contract , which will need to be executed if you want to
do the test project . the second is an addendum to that time and materials
contract under section h , which allows for specific work statements to amend
and supersede the general consulting agreement . the general consulting
agreement ( termsandconditions . doc ) contains all the confidentiality , billing
rate , and other provisions that your contract people will probably want and
provides a general framework for doing business . the work statement
( testproject . doc ) contains the specific provisions for our standard weeklong
onsite test project .
i hope we get the opportunity to serve you and ultimately to make
marketpoint available to you . in light of the contiguity to the holidays , i
dont think it would be realistic to try to schedule this test project before
then , probably from your perpsective as well as ours . let ' s think about
doing it the first opportunity in january if you decide to go forward if
that is ok with you .
all the best .
