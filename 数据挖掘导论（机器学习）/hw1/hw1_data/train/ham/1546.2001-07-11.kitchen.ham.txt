subject : bnycp litigation analysis : privileged and confidential
attached are the memoranda prepared by outside counsel assessing the bnycp litigation . to avoid as much confusion as possible , i suggest reading the andrews & kurth memo first , the bernstein memo second and the risk matrix last .
in a nutshell , all agree that this is a very fact intensive case and that there has been little factual discovery to date . it is also agreed that we have been denied the benefit of some of the evidence available as a result of the confidentiality obligations in place . accordingly , much of the analysis provided is really counsel ' s " best guess " based on the information available .
that being said , there seems to be a general agreement that , based on the facts currently available and the " quick and dirty " analysis that we have been able to do , the exposure ranges from approximately $ 20 to $ 50 million . interest and attorney fees could also prove significant .
i am available to discuss this further if you think that would be helpful . thanks for your patience .
