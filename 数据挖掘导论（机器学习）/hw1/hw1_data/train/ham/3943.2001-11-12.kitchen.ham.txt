Subject: thanks for a good visit and plans for the future
dear friends
naturally the news about enron has not escaped anyone and i will come back to
his in a while .
but first and foremost i would like to thank you for the great gesture to
receive the abb delegation late last month . you kept the meeting despite the
turmoil and managed to make the meeting very productive . to me that illustrates
a great company with great people staying together but also staying close to
partner and the business also in difficult times . our discussions where
productive and for me personally a good illustration of the competence and
knowledge in your organisation .
back to the recent news i understand that the ownership structure will change
for enron but we from abb sincerely hope that the knowledge , spirit and
entrepreneurial spirit that formed enron will be preserved in the new
organisation . we look forward to opportunities to develop and build projects
together with you for the benefit of both organisations .
if there is anything we can do further to support your business please call mike
as before and i will make sure he gets the backup needed .
be proud and look forward to see you again !
