Subject: west power contracts - estate
don ,
process is well underway with the west power portfolio . we have the portfolio sorted by :
- mtm position
- terminated vs active
- collection risk
- type of contract
we have strategies for our top 5 exposures representing $ 600 mm + of estate assets and we are in discussions with several marketers that are looking at assignments . there are 5 commercial and 3 legal people working on this .
going forward , jonalan page ( portland estate ) is interested and would be very good . brad richter is also interested and has one or two junior commercial people in mind to help as well ( brandon wax ) . i think brad is a perfect fit - he knows some of the contracts , counterparties and he knows the marketers and attorneys in portland . he and i spoke today and agreed that it made sense for him to start working on this subject to your approval .
my thought is that the commercial and legal team expands with the addition of brad , brandon and jonalan and then it contracts when netco starts pulling them in a different direction in january .
regards ,
