ms . crenshaw ,
thank you very much for the message . i am very interested in the
opportunity to talk to personnel from the research group at enron . between
the two days you suggest , i prefer wednesday 12 / 6 . considering the
two - hour time difference between california and texas , 11 : 00 am pacific
time ( 1 : 00 pm your time ) seems to be a good slot . however , i am open most
of the day on 12 / 6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end ,
please let me know .
thanks again . i look forward to talking to you and your
colleagues .
