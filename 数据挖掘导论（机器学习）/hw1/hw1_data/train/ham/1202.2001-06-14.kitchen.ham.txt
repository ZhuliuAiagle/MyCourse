sorry i didn ' t reply last week but i promised myself i wouldn ' t reply to anyone unless i had had six hours sleep !
anyway - how i thought we had left it was that you were going to aproach them on splitting the cost - $ 1 . 3 m each and that would be it . ask them if this is ok - if not let ' s sort it out next week .
thanks
