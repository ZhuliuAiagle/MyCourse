Subject: re : marketpoint gas model
john :
thanks for the information . chaim and i were aware that you might be
changing roles at enron . i am delighted kim is slated to take over the
reins working with vince . kim has put in a good bit of time in the past few
years reviewing our stuff and setting up contacts for us in your company .
we will give kim a call early next week after easter . we have made a lot of
progress on marketpoint , which i think will be of keen interest to your
team . the introductory activity as well as the ongoing , inhouse
architecture are both improved relative to what you and your people were
able to review , and i anticipate you will be pleased and impressed .
john , it isnt that easy for you to get away from us ! remember the story of
the tar baby . ( just kidding . ) all the best , and i hope we get the chance
to serve you and make your organization even better .
dale
