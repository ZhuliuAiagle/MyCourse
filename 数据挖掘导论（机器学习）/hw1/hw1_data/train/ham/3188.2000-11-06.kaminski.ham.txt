steve ,
rac will be a bit unhappy about it . i think that bjorn will object to it .
let me talk to you tomorrow over the phone and discuss it .
the question is how to present it to rac in a such a way that
rodrigo will not be put in a bad light .

hi vince
i ' ve had a chat with rodrigo lamas , who is a bit unhappy in his current role
in rac ( he wants to be a bit more proactive , and finds the inertia
frustrating ) . i would be very interested in bringing him into research with
responsibility for var / risk mgt , which is where his professional experience
lies . he also has a phd in optimization from imperial college london which
i ' m sure we can make use of .
there will obviously be some political issues involving such a move only 4
months into his career at enron , and if you ' re able then i ' m sure he ' d
appreciate a chat with you .
we ' re awaiting your response before rodrigo mentions this to anyone else .
steve
