Subject: fw : first cut canada data
hi savita ,
attached is the ugly first cut at data for canada . the sheets are a jumble of information , but the jist of it is this :
* canada did a lot more activity on their nit term physical products during the peak may - julyo 0 period than they did during the low novo 0 - janol period . ( 3000 trades vs 1550 trades ) .
* the only significant product offering difference between the two periods was the gd / d sumas product , which was offered in may - july , but not nov - jan . ( accounts for relatively few trades )
* enron north america did a higher percentage of the trading on canadian gas products in novo 0 - janol than they did during the earlier months .
* there are a handful of counterparties such as murphy oil and dynegy marketing which conducted business with canada on eol before and since the nov - jan lull period , but did not do online transactions with us during the three months where our trade volumes and deal counts were lowest .
