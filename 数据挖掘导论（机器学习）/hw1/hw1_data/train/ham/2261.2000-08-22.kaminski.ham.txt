margaret ,
please find attached file with average monthly prices for regions your
requested . this file gives more information than the previous ( yesterday )
one . as the one before , source for this file is megawatt daily , it includes
on - peak and off - peak prices and you can also see daily data that was
converted to monthly average data . there are two types of averages prices :
average and weighted average . weighted average takes into account number of
transactions of certain price .
for example : pjm had average price of $ 53 . 61 and weighted average price of
$ 53 . 15 in august , it means that there were more transactions of lower price
than higher . also , megawatt daily has its own methodology and i am attaching
it with this message .
