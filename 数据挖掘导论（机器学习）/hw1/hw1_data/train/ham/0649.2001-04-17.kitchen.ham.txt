Subject: re : balance sheet
we currently have an epc contract with the city of austin to develop a project using the lm 6000 ' s that we sold to them . this is followed by a 2 year ppa at a fixed heat rate . it is currently being managed by mike curry . doug gilbert - smith and i are both ready to elevate drew tingleaf to a leadership position in ercot . we both think that his leadership would be valuable for the group and that the mike curry issue can be managed . any problems ?
