Subject: sap expense report form
with the implementation of sap , the employee expense report form has been
modified to reflect the new coding system . the procedures for its use are
unchanged , but there are some cosmetic differences . one item to note : the
form no longer requires entry of your social security number ; instead use
your new personnel number assigned through human resources ( see
http : / / hrweb . enron . com ) . for electronically submitted expense reports , enter
the same number on the receipt envelope .
the form is now available at the sap website . to access the form :
from the enron home page , go to the sap intranet site http : / / sap . enron . com
choose one of the following paths :
click on quick reference tools on the left menu
click drop - down arrow for accounts payable forms
click sap expense report form
click on forms and procedures library on the left menu
click drop - down arrow for accounts payable forms
click sap expense report form
wait for it to load
click enable macros ( or yes , allow macros )
after you enter the data , save as excel workbook ( . xls file extension ) with a
new filename . do not save as excel template ( . xlt extension ) .
you may print the spreadsheet for submission to accounts payable , or attach
it to notes for electronic submission . instructions are available at the
website , on the same drop down box as the form .
