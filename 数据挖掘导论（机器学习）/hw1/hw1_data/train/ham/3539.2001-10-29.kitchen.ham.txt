Subject: enrononline phase iii designs
hi louise ,
we ' ve made some great headway with the agency in terms of concepts for the new look of enrononline . we have one week left to lock down the design before we start building it and i would love to take a few minutes to show you the designs . would you happen to have some time this week to go over the concepts ?
take care ,
