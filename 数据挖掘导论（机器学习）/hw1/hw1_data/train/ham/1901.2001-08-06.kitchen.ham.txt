Subject: capacity center
louise -
just wanted to give you an update on where we stand with this company :
as you read from tommy ' s due diligence summary there are numerous issues with the technology , but the collection of realtime capacity offers / awards , critical notices and historical database does have value for enron .
what we have to determine is :
1 . the value of the software / hardware ( as it exists today )
2 . the price we are willing to pay to capacity center to provide the operational services needed to run the system ( for one year )
3 . the price to charge skipping stone ( the parent ) for ad hoc reporting access to the historical database to support their consulting service business
4 . are we comfortable with the legal structure of the historical database with the " national registry of capacity rights "
tommy is working up his opinion on what the answer to numbers one and two should be . steve van hooser will be looking into number four .
i expect to throw an proposal back to capacity center / skipping stone when i return from vacation in two weeks . i am also expecting to hear back from danny mccarty on the pipelines ' willingness to join in on the purchase of this company .
please call me if you have any comments .
