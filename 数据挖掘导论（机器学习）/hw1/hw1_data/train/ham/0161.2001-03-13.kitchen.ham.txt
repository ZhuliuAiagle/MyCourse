Subject: re : restraining order
i think the concern is around scott mills . he was brought down to accelerate the mid / back - office fixes for ees , primarily as it relates to system changes / improvements . we ' re bringing anthony dayao back from japan to head up ees it and he ' ll be leaning on scott quite a bit i believe .
how does your schedule look later today or tomorrow ? i would like to sit down for a few minutes to discuss the status of the eol products for ees / ena and also to talk a little bit about some customer overlap between the two groups and how to handle it . i ' ll have kay set up some time for us .
