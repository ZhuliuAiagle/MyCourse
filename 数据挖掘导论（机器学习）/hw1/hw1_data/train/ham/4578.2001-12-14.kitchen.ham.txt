Subject: data room binders complete
came up to the 6 th floor to see you a little after 5 : 00 today , but it was very quite on 6 . sorry that i missed you . i had earlier delivered to mary cook 5 binders of operational information for ea . brought my copy by just to show you what we had put together . mary is planning to e - mail you the index list from the binders . the binders are well - organized , color - coded and filled with information that appropriately addresses the controls and operational reporting that are used in managing the gas and power business .
i will take my copy home with me over the weekend so that i can address any questions that may come up . we expect to substitute a more updated version of our cash collections process flow on monday , assuming that leslie reeves has returned from jury duty . she apparently has the " prettier " version of the process flow , but has been tied up fullfilling her civic duty . - sally
