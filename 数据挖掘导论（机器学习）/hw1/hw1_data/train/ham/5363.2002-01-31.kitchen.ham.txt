Subject: headcount for energy op ' s and finance / accounting
in order for wes ' s team to handle the curve validation and reporting responsibilities under the ubsw preferred delineation of responsibilities between op ' s and accounting / finance , he estimates a need for 3 people . as i understand it , while in enron terms these activities were previously handled in sally ' s area , a transfer of 3 people from her team is not possible , primarily as a consequence of them not having bought anyone across in gossetts team to handle physical business . apparently these people were cut in the last round of headcount reductions pre - offers .
bottom - line , wes needs to go ahead and get 3 people on board quickly so would you confirm how you want to proceed :
1 . are you ok with incremental headcount or does the energy op ' s or another headcount budget reduce by 3 to balance the books and keep overall at 650 .
2 . can i go ahead and put a contract offer in front of kevin sweeney ?
3 . can we produce a standard offer for 2 other people including a sign - on representative of what they might have received in bonus ( these are 2 snr spec level so this would be in the teens ) .
