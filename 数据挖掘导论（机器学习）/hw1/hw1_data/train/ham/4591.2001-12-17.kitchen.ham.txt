as you know i have business flights home each year under my contract . as i will be unable to travel to the uk due to the requirement to be in houston over the holidays i intend to use them for my parents , borther and sister - in - law . any difference in the cost i intend to cover or offset against the cheques from expenses which bounced until we can figure out whether enron intends to meet expense payments .
