carly fiorina tops fortune ' s list of 50 most powerful women in business
for fourth year

new york - - ( business wire ) - - oct . 1 , 2001 - -
lower - profile women topple more well - known names from tech and
internet sector ; ranking includes 14 newcomers
though hewlett - packard lost $ 75 billion in market value in a year , ceo carly
fiorina hasn ' t lost her nerve , and for the fourth consecutive year holds the
no . 1 position on fortune ' s ranking of the 50 most powerful women in business .
the complete list and accompanying stories are in the october 15 issue of
fortune , available on newsstands october 8 and at www . fortune . com at 12 : 00
p . m . on october 1 .
in the no . 2 spot is ebay ceo meg whitman , who runs an internet company that
actually makes money : $ 85 million in the last four quarters on $ 582 million in
revenue . oprah winfrey , the queen of media , is mightier than ever , and holds
the no . 3 spot , up from no . 15 last year . she produces movies , brings comfort
and advice to millions of tv viewers , propels books to bestsellerdom , and ,
last year , teamed up with hearst magazines ' cathie black ( no . 28 on the list )
to publish o , the oprah magazine - by some measures the most successful magazine
startup ever . at no . 4 is andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon , who has
breathed life into ailing avon . mirant ceo marce fuller - the only newcomer in
the top five - holds the no . 5 position . inside a stodgy utility , southern ,
fuller built a high - growth trading and marketing unit , which was spun off in
april .
in these new , more tempered times , patience may be about to reap its reward .
in fortune ' s annual survey of the 50 most powerful women in business , there is
a clear emergence of women who came to power slowly . says fortune senior
writer pattie sellers in " patient but not passive , " the story that accompanies
the list , " by patience , we mean staying with a company , steadily building
influence there , and rising to power through determination and insider
knowledge , not promises and self - promotion . "
fiorina , who has claimed the top spot each year since fortune ' s inaugural
list in 1998 , heads the biggest company ( $ 48 billion in revenues last year )
run by a woman . and she is still as audacious and impatient as ever . wall
street practically heckled her latest move - a bold bet to buy compaq - but
fiorina , 47 , remains defiant . in difficult times , " people who drive change are
the subject of great scrutiny , " she says .
as always , the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time . last year ,
power resided in the technology and internet sectors , but that influence was
fleeting . gone from the list this year : deborah " hurricane debby " hopkins , who
pushed her agenda too ambitiously at lucent and lost her cfo job in may ; ellen
hancock , who failed at her startup , exodus ; and morgan stanley ' s mary meeker ,
who influenced so many to buy into the internet fizz . but one web warrior
looks better than ever : meg whitman , no . 2 on the list . she has never
overpromised to investors ; instead she has diligently delivered above - target
profits every single quarter .
fourteen newcomers join the list this year : marce fuller , president louise kitchen , coo , enron americas ; colleen barrett , president betsy bernard , president & ceo , at anne
stevens , vp , north america vehicle operations , ford motor ; maria elena
lagomasino , chairman susan desmond - hellman ,
evp and chief medical officer , genentech ; janet robinson , svp , newspaper
operations , new york times co . ; carol tomi , evp and cfo , home depot ; carrie
cox , evp and president , global prescriptions , pharmacia ; carole black ,
president and ceo , lifetime television networks ; larree renda , evp , retail
operations , safeway ; and louise francesconi , vp and gm , missile systems ,
raytheon .
while the economy and its points of power change , the criteria we use to
evaluate power remains the same . says sellers : " we consider the size and
importance of a woman ' s business in the global economy , her clout inside her
company , and the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely
to go . when appropriate , we also weigh the woman ' s influence on mass culture
and society . that factor lifts oprah winfrey to no . 3 on this year ' s list . "
the shifts on our list this year are dramatic , with 14 newcomers . but one
trend is especially intriguing : women are taking on bigger businesses than
ever . a few years ago , responsibility for a $ 3 billion business almost
automatically earned a woman a spot on this list . no more . this year ' s fortune
50 includes several women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $ 20
billion or more , which is a first .
in a related story , " it took a lady to save avon , " katrina brooker looks at
andrea jung , chairman and ceo of avon . says brooker , " jung knows what women
want and how to sell it to them . and that ' s what has made her one of the most
successful ceos - male or female - in recent years . " over the past 20 months she
has overhauled nearly everything about the way avon does business : how it
advertises , manufactures , packages , and even sells its products , and she has
done it not by abandoning the seemingly outdated avon lady , but by reviving
her . the result : growth in revenues , operating profits , and operating margins .
in addition , fortune includes an international list of the 50 powerful women
in business . the top ten , featured in the magazine , are marjorie scardino ,
ceo , pearson ( britain ) ; anne lauvergeon , chairman , areva ( france ) ; mary ma ,
senior vp marianne nivert , president lien siaou - sze , vice president , hewlett - packard ( hong kong ) ;
patricia barbizet , ceo , artemis ( france ) ; eiko kono , president , recruit
( japan ) : belinda stronach , ceo , magna international ( canada ) ; marina
berlusconi , vice chairman , fininvest ( italy ) ; christine tsung , president &
ceo , china airlines ( taiwan ) . you can read about the other forty at
www . fortune . com or in the international editions of fortune .
