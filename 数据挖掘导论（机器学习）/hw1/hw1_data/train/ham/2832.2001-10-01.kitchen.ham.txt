Subject: ena it
louise ,
i need to bring this to close .
i am going to decompose beth ' s group into a number of smaller units , leaving the most important areas in ena , namely gas / power front and back office . i am going to leave anthony running ees , but need someone who can work well with anthony on developing the strategy for the new longer term solutions , as well as what he is trying to achieve in the short term .
the final candidates are steve stock , everett plant , and as possible late entry john paskin ( although he doesn ' t know this yet and i have him tagged to run corporate systems ) . from a collaboration perspective i am leaning towards stocky . we have all spoken with everett and are impressed with his ' gloss ' . i ' m just not sure he is the right person to give the ' crown jewels ' to , my gut tells me he is good at managing up , but may not be the best collaborative team member ( and i need that ) .
let mk know what you think
thanks
oh , and thanks for the baseball the other night , we had fun .
