notes
? since calgary office has not yet implemented the new gdi calc , there was a double counting issue with canadian gas daily books last friday , july 27 . the it team has been working closely with calgary office to fix the problem as soon as possible .
? in the last couple of weeks , a developer took a week and half off due to a family emergency and another developer took paternity leave for a week , which affected our project delivery timelines .
