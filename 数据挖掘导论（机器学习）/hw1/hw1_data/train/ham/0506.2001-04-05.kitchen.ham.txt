attached is mr . lydecker ' s spreadsheet where i have added the basis for the hpl and lrc assets to be included in special assets plus those that will be leased or sold to aep . i was not sure if you wanted anything in the market value columns so i have only provided book values or investment basis amounts . we can further breakdown the hpl and lrc assets into the components that lydecker is breaking them into by friday . i also provided the buy - out values for looper and midtexas and for your reference just to account for everything i also added jean ' s balances at the bottom below the special assets totals . call me on my cell phone if you have questions . 713 - 825 - 7240 .
