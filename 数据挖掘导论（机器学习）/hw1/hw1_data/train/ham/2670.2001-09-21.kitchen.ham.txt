Subject: dealbench , tobias munk
hi don ,
the investment climate out there is very harsh , as you probably know . for me to raise vc money i need to show client business .
if you could confirm to me on a non - binding basis that enron americas is looking to continue to use dealbench datarooms and that a platform lease of a substantial value could be reached , that would help me a great deal in the process . please feel free to amend in any way you feel fit and be as specific or unspecific as you see appropriate .
please reply to my enron e - mail as well as my private e - mail
tobiasmunk @ yahoo . com
thanks very much and i will be in touch ( after the quarter and your successful divestitures : - )
