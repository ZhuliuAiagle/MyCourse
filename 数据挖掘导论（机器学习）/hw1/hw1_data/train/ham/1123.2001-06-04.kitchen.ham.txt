Subject: aa exec lead / congrats !
louise ,
first - congratulations on the new baby ! life has just changed big time in case you haven ' t already noticed ( i have 3 daughters myself ) . best wishes on your new addition .
second - i wanted to test your interest on being the exec lead for carnegie - mellon associate recruiting this fall . i ' ve been assuming ( maybe incorrectly ) that with your new responsibilities ( home and work ) that you might pass on it this year - but i want that to be your decision . if you want to do it , we certainly would appreciate your help . if you can ' t do it , i ' d appreciate any recommendation you might have for a replacement . i ' d prefer a senior level ( vp or above ) alum , if possible . i ' ll find someone if no names come to mind immediately .
take care and i hope all is well ,
billy
