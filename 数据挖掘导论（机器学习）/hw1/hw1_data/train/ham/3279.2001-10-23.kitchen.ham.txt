Subject: hpl in 2002
louise :
some guidance on how you want to handle the ongoing hpl costs / reserve management for next year . specifically , there will be a number of items that roll into next year that will have to be managed . i am going with the assumption that jim will report into wes and will be responsible for supporting this effort .
question : do you want me to assume : ( i ) that i have a seperate cost center for hpl and that has jim ' s cost allocated to it , or ( ii ) should this whole effort just role up to wes and then i can support it on an as needed basis ?
i ' m open to either , but my recommendation is to keep some commercial oversight over the settlement of the outstanding hpl issues . because , if things start coming unglued , i ' m sure i will get dragged back into it anyway .
regards ,
brian
