hello again !
i promise i am not running ! the deal that we worked out with the general
manager ( tom pratt ) is that enron has a $ 6000 credit with the great divide
lodge that will expire on 8 / 1 / 00 . you can either use that credit for
individual rooms prior to 8 / 1 / 00 , or we have agreed that we can apply that
amount to a meeting prior to the thanksgiving holiday in 2000 if the contract
is signed before 8 / 1 / 00 .
at this point , august 18 - 20 is available , but the 25 - 28 is not . if we can
get this signed prior to 7 / 31 / 00 , your $ 6000 credit would be able to be
applied to this event .
please let me know if this will work for you . thanks !
steve

hello steve :
please don ' t run ! i know after the last fiasco with an enron offsite you are
probably running for the hills !
i do want to apologize to you and thank you for all of your assistance even
though we were unable to make the trip .
however , i understand there has been an arrangement made with enron ,
that if we book a time and come before thanksgiving we can recoup the money
that we forfeited ? please let me know if i am understanding this correctly .
if so , we have been told that our group can use this for an offsite .
we are looking at the weekends of august 18 , 19 and 20 or august 25 ,
26 and 27 th . there will be approximately 12 people .
please let me know your understanding of the arrangement and the
availability of the dates mentioned .
look forward to hearing from you .
regards ,
