to clarify :
1 . the guarantee issue is already in play with the canadian pipelines , power pools , office landlords , etc . and will be an impediment to closing and / or commencing business operations ;
2 . it is not that counterparties will be unlikely to transact with this new ubsw canadian entity without credit support . . . they will not ;
3 . although parental g ' ee of ubs ag as credit support will help , the structure of a non - creditworthy sub supported by a parental g ' ee ( with its own terms , conditions and limits ) is the old enron structure , and it may well not be well received in the industry .

canada appears to be an issue .
we need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the us the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be ubs ag , london division but ubs warburg energy ( canada ) ltd . with the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from ubs , this is going to be an issue .
there are two main points , because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers .
please let me know how we can progress on this .
