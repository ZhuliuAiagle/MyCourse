Subject: re : netco
anne ,
i was responding to louise ' s request . i understood her request as one of identifying what we used and then deciding whether it made sense to bring them . if i can ' t have any of below systems we will be ok , but i will probably need one or two more people and a budget to buy a personnel database of some nature .

it is my understanding that sap is not being transferred and i don ' t think the other systems are going either . please find out from a commercial person what is contemplated on the hr side .

subject : netco
as we move forward in the planning stages for netco we need to identify all systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity . we have identified the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to identify particular tools used by your group or you individually . this would include spreadsheets etc .
please send lists of systems and software required to anne koehler by close of business today .
to be clear we can ( subject to the negotiation ) move / copy systems and some data however , we cannot move either transaction data if counterparty specific or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement .
for houston traders , geof storey is compiling your lists .
thanks
louise
