Subject: employment agreements - parquet and mcdonald
i spoke with parquet and mcdonald re contracts and offered the following :
parquet :
base - $ 200 - no increase
signing - $ 100
equity - $ 250
mcdonald :
base - $ 175 - no increase
signing - $ 75
equity - $ 200
parquet ' s is identical to what you offered ; mcdonald is significantly less than parquet and right in between parquet and dyer ( 50 / 150 ) .
