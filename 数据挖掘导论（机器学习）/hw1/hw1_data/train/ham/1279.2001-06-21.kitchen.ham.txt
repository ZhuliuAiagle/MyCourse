louise ,
a detailed discussion of all of the assets currently under management by ecr is being prepared by jesus melendrez and is near completion . i am meeting with pam becton in the morning to review the various off balance sheet vehicles . the assets that are in active divestiture process are cgas and juniper . an agent has been engaged for the juniper assets . we are in discussion with a group on cgas . we expect both of these transactions to close by year end but hopefully in the 3 rd quarter . the preston i & ii vpps were syndicated into brazos in december ' 00 and january ' 01 , respectively . the crescendo ( $ 7 . 5 mm ) vpp was syndicated into brazos in december ' 00 . the remainder of the crescendo vpps should be moved into brazos by year end or lq ' 02 once a second vpp transaction occurs . the kcs vpp ( $ 159 mm ) is set to close and fund no later than 6 / 27 according to tim proffitt . hanson is an accrual and may be sold by year end if no other drilling occurs . ameritex , cypress , sam gary / bonne terre , vastar , texland are assets that are still in development . crescendo , westwin , nutech and preston equity are recent transactions ( < lyr old ) . several options are being reviewed on mariner - ( i ) sale or merger with another company , ( ii ) ipo , provided enron gets its debt repaid and 75 % of its equity sold at an enterprise valuation of $ 500 mm or greater ( the megs pipeline asset would be included in this option ) , or ( iii ) continue to develop the asset . we will make our recommendation on mariner once allan keel completes his analysis .
i recognize that this explanation is brief . let me know if you need additional information or would like to meet to discuss further .
