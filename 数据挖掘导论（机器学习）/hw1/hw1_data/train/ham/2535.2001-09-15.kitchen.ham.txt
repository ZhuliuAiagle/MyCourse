the state senate adjourned early saturday without voting on a plan to rescue southern california edison from bankruptcy , and gov . gray davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility .
as the california legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session , a $ 200 million program to help the state ' s neediest schools won approval . so did bills to give driver ' s licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds .
but senators remained cool to davis ' idea of bailing out southern california edison . they failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the assembly , which also adjourned early saturday .
" we didn ' t take it up because we didn ' t want to embarrass the governor , " said president pro tem john burton . " it would have been a rip - off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation . "
the deal ' s quiet death closed more than five months of work since davis first announced the plan in april , saying the state would pay $ 2 . 76 billion for edison ' s transmission system and let the utility sell consumer - backed bonds to repay the rest of its $ 3 . 9 billion debt .
without the deal , edison faces bankruptcy along with pacific gas and electric co . , the state ' s largest utility . the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in april , after amassing about $ 8 . 9 billion in debt due to last year ' s sky - high electricity costs . edison says it has accrued $ 3 . 9 billion in debts .
the special session is meant to take another shot at saving edison from sliding into bankruptcy .
" i am proud of the work done by the assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring edison to creditworthiness , " davis in a statement after midnight saturday . " unfortunately , however , the senate has not gotten the job done . "
the new school - improvement program would provide grants of $ 400 per student to schools with the state ' s lowest test scores . they will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school .
the shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law . those include a 10 - minute rest break for every four hours of work , tools paid for by the employer and toilets , lights and water in housing .
it also would put into state law a $ 1 , 050 - a - month minimum wage for sheepherders .
while legislators toiled , tuesday ' s terrorist attacks were never far from their minds .
davis joined the assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks .
the legislature approved sending $ 1 million from the california victim compensation fund to a similar program in new york to help victims of the terrorist attacks .
the letters will be printed in a special assembly journal .
" here in california , our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance , " said davis .
