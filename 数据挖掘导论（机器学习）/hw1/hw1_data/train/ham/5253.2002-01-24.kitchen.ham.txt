louise ,
jim fallon told to wait for explicit intructions from him
before any transfer to netco takes place . he is my current boss .
i am afraid we are caught up in a legal mess here . all i need
is a formal letter or an e - mail . another alternative is to extend
employment of some of my guys who are supposed to help with the transistion .

who stayed behind to facilitate the transition will be leaving

does the state have copies of all programs ? should systems manage the migration ? muller was going to send vince the copy of the contract indicating the section to vince that required the turnover just to make sure we were doing the right thing - did that happen ?
