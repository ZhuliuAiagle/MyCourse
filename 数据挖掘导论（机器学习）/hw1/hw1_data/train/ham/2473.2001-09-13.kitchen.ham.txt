Subject: fw : paul goddard - done deal
i have talked to paul again , and he is keen to work in toronto wholesale origination . i propose that he starts october 15 as he needs to clean his plate in the uk first . he will be contacting brad richter today to confirm his intent . brad knows he was talking to us .
rob :
1 . he comes well recommended by louise
2 . i talked with him a couple times and he seems very personable and capable
3 . i think we should hire him reporting to borg . borg needs additional commercial people to completely cover the market
dawn , on rob ' s say so , please create an offer letter and e - mail to him . i will send salary proposal on a separate e - mail to you . you will also need to work out relocation costs from the uk .
cheers , paul d

paul goddard is a manager in the london office looking to come home to canada ( calgary or toronto ) and has spoken to paul in toronto . paul is a strong manager who has been in the organisation for several years . i know that paul has a position offer in dynegy ( from pope obviously ) . i think that it would be good for you to have a chat with him to see if there is a fit as i wouldn ' t want to lose him . at the moment , he seems very keen on toronto and working in power retail - he definitely doesn ' t want to leave enron .
his number is + 44 7748 932298
thanks
louise
