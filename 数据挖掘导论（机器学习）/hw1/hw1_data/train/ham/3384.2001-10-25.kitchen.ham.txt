attached is the listing of items that we have accrued but not paid as of sept 30 th . we do have several items due to bridgeline from enron . the first is that we have not received 16 months of the ces asset management payments from enron ( 16 x $ 50 , 000 = $ 800 , 000 ) and the second is the btu conversion adjustment to pad gas for aug and sept that jean has agreed to . this amount is $ 274 , 000 . net net , we owe enron approx $ 226 , 000 .
give me a call if you want a detail explanation on any of this .
thanks
