Subject: gordon heaney ' s acceptance
fyi - beth apollo led the doorstep review in monterrey last week . no problems discovered - but beth did find some communications and system access issues that could be improved to make it easier for max ' s team to do their jobs . she has quickly identified a point person within operations in houston who is bi - lingual ( gordon ) . max ' s note addresses his pleasure over beth ' s responsiveness and the doorstep process in general . just wanted to pass this along . - - sally
