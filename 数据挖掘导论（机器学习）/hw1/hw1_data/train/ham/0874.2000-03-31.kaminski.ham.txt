subject : uk ppi curve generator with smoothing
hi martina & trena ,
i think this is a reasonable smoothing method between the short and long - term
models - let me know if you need me to explain it . i also included the
short - term models so this is now a self - standing spreadsheet , but probably
still needs cleaning up a bit .
zimin & stinson :
we agreed on short - term and long - term models for dzcv and pllu ppi indices in
a meeting with dale and trena and a simple smoothing is employed to give the
results as follows . blue and red curves are the proposed dzcv and pllu ppi
index forward curves whilst rpi is the market - derived black curve .
regards ,
anjam
