Subject: ok so i ' m having trouble letting go . . . . . . .
9 : 00 am greg and i and louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff .
10 : 00 am we will meet discuss staff . we need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs . we have a lot of front office spots . slone , you need to get us a front office count by region .
i suggest that hunter and dave ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next monday . we should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3 . i suggest presto works with gaskill and will and the h guy i can ' t spell in portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week tuesday . i would like to have a clue before i start trading .
hunter on the gas trading side i say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best organization structure . it will get everyone working . we need that . i would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they ' re focused on business .
i also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching enron shit all day .
