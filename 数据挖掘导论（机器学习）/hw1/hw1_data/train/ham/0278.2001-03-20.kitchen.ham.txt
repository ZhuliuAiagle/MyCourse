Subject: re : dotted versus straight lines
louise ,
i left a message with brian after receiving his phone message this morning , but have not had a chance to talk with him . i have told no one solid or dotted line . in response to a direct question from bruce golden in brian ' s group about what the reference to development engineers meant in the announcement , i told him development engineers were " connected " to eeos as a part to technical quality control from a corporate perspective . with others , brian stanley and i have used the concept that the development engineers are aligned to the business units but seconded from eeos . this allows movement to best satisfy corporate needs if required . we felt this approach fits our none profit center aligned to wholesale charter . as you state , we still have to work the details of our role in support of the wholesale business units .
aside , i have the least concerns with brian ' s group . with brian , we have a focal point to communicate above the day - to - day chatter and navigate over the hurdles left stacked with ee & cc baggage .
brian stanley is planning to spend a couple of weeks here sorting these types of issues .

until there is another agreement between the three of you the message is :
the technical staff in enron americas will continue to report on a straight line to brian who will work out the nature of his dotted line to the new group in the future .
let ' s keep the business as usual , no change message to avoid any further miscommunications until you all sit down together .
thanks
