stinson ,
i have attached a file along with this email
that lists the software needed for our
java class .
we would like to do the class from monday thru
friday , 8 am to 5 pm . that way we can complete
the class within a week . we are unable to offer
classes in the evenings or for few hours a week .
we usually teach week long courses for our
other clients and because of that we won ' t
be available .
currently , we can do the class from feb . 19 th
through feb . 23 ( that is if you are working on
feb 19 th , president ' s day ) .
i will call you sometime this afternoon to talk
further . please feel free to reach me if you have
any further questions in the mean time .
regards ,
- siva
