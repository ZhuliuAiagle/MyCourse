given the growth in ees it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate
the risk functions between ees and ews . this will provide ees with the
systems , resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market

with this in mind and in agreement with the management of ees , two new risk
groups inside enron americas will be formed to provide ees with pricing ,
structuring , retail and wholesale commodity risk management , logistics and
back - office services . these groups main function is to provide these
services to ees . we have asked rogers herndon , currently vice
president - trading in the eastern power group to manage this function in the
eastern interconnect ( this includes both gas and power ) . rogers will
continue to report to kevin presto . we have asked don black , formerly vice
president - ees risk management and sourcing , to manage this function in the
western u . s . don will manage this group from houston and will report to tim
belden .
these groups will work very closely with ees to pursue shared goals while
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading
