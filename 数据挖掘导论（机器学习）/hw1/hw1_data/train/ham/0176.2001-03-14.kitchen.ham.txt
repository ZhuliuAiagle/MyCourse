Subject: pastoria - kern
calpine just confirmed the following : tomorrow they will commit to 50 - 100 per day of kern expansion . they will commit 100 / day if enron commits to take 50 of it if the project sale does not close . if enron does not commit to the 50 , they will only go in for 50 and enron will not have any rights to it .
bottom line - we have gone from needing to commit to 100 / day of transport to 0 - 50 per day . we will need to decide on this tomorrow morning .
