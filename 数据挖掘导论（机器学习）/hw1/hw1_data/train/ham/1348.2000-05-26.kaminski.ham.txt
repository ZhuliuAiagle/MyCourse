kevin ,
per your request , please see below :
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
new facsimile machine information
please take a look @ the following and let me know , which fax machine you
choose or if you need information on something smaller , then i will have the
vendor contact you directly to finalise installation . an enron director or
above { with signature authority to legally bind enron to a contract } will
have to sign off on the contract paperwork before the fax machine can be
installed . delivery times on new machines are normally 3 - 5 working days but
either vendor listed below will be able to provide a " loaner " should you have
a business need . please discuss the fax machine install date with the rep
when ordering the equipment .
if there is no existing fax line present , you will need to send a notes - mail
to the move team { erica @ x 3 - 3185 or janelle @ x 5 - 7917 } requesting the
installation of a new fax line . the move team can be found in the notes - mail
" ect address book " .
if you are an ees employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ees budget control . contact susan mcleroy @ x 5 - 8066 or via notes - mail .
if you are an ebs employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ebs purchasing & budget control . contact paula corey @ x 3 - 9948 or martha
reyna @ x 3 - 3491 . you can reach both of these people via notes - mail .
if you are an ena employee , you must first get new equipment approval from
ena finance & budget control . contact lorie belsha @ x 3 - 9617 or via
notes - mail .
a note on the fax machines listed below :
all the machines listed below come with a 2 nd paper tray and upgraded memory
{ maxed by model ~ see below } as an enron standard from each vendor .
all the fax machines listed below have a modem speed rated @ 33 . 6 kbps versus
the canon laserclass 7500 { example only } @ 14 . 4 kbps = new fax machine should
be noticeably quicker .
document feeder capacity of the machines listed below are the same as the
canon laserclass 7500 { example only }
maintenance = models listed below have maintenance / repair coverage included
in monthly $ total . there is no separate agreement ! toner / drum cartridges +
paper + line charges are extra { not quoted }
contract pricing can change without warning , so please let me know asap if a
vendor quotes you a different price to those listed below against the various
models .
if the fax machine is to be used in a trading type environment , here are some
considerations :
no more than 20 people per fax machine = take a look @ the fax machine
placement on eb 30 or eb 31 .
disregard any fax machine that does not have a 33 . 6 k modem and jbig
compression { or equivalent } .
look for memory upgrades & 2 nd paper tray included in monthly cost . { models
quoted are loaded } .
maintenance is to be included in monthly cost { models quoted are covered } .

the above machines are designed for workgroup use .
q ) how many people will be using this fax machine ?
q ) how much usage will this fax machine have ?
{ i . e . heavy = 40 faxes per day @ 20 pages / 60 faxes per day @ 2 - 3 pages or a
lot less ? if " heavy " , either the pb 2050 , pb 9930 or uf 885 / uf 895 should fit
your needs = if 15 - 40 , the pb 9830 would probably be a better fit }
