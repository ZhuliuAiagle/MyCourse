ok . my feelings are that it is down to eel to decide who should do their expats returns at pwc . my conversation with drew , tara and jim concluded with them deciding that they and their expats liked phil and although they had made everyone aware of this issue they were going to give him another chance .
my advice is to let it go .

that they are keeping hawkins in london and nobody bothered to reply to my message - so i rang sherriff and told him what had happened - he is now spooked because he doesn ' t even check his tax return - he just signs them .
i partly annoyed because they didn ' t respond to my message nor tell sherriff anything of the problems .

if this has not been done - i would like to know who is requesting phillip is retained . i spoke to john who was not aware of the issues - he does feel that this tax year is out of the question . but going forward this should be an issue - john was also unaware of the advice i had been given which is clearly incorrect .
why did i receive no response to this email should the action i requested not have been implemented .

i have recently had some very bad experiences with philip ' s advice and suggest that he is removed from enron ' s account completely . obviously david has had him removed from working on anything this side of the atlantic .
i feel strongly that enron employees should not be exposed to the potential liabilities which could be incurred through incorrect advice and would suggest your side of the water remove him also in the interests of enron as a whole .
if you want to know the details let me know . let me know if you have problems removing him and i will further explain why i think our individuals are at risk .
