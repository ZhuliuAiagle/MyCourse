dear vince ,
since we last corresponded , i have left lsu and am now professor of finance &
insurance at baylor university in waco , tx . my colleague at baylor , john
martin , mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on
friday , february 23 that he is organizing . i am curious whether your schedule
might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our
dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of gamma iota sigma , a national
risk management fraternity . for that matter , would you also possibly be
available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate students on
the previous day ( thursday , february 22 ) ? what i have in mind is a
presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my lsu
classes .
thank you for your consideration of this request . i am looking forward to
seeing you once again .
sincerely ,
jim garven
