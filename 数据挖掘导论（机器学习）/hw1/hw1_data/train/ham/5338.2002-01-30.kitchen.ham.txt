Subject: million dollar content
louise ,
we tried to find a way around the $ 250 , 000 portalbuilder charge for content which i emailed you about before .
looks like there isn ' t a way - and in fact , the total charge will be closer to $ 1 , 000 , 000 , including all of the components needed for content .
so , the official question is : do you want us to spend this much to preserve the ability to carry enrononline content , or do we revise the quotes page to exclude content ?
i am personally having a hard time finding value for money in this expense - but you mentioned before that ubs were keen to preserve existing functionality .
