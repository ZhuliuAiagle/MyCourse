Subject: weather and crude
the list of proposed netco employees that amy fitzpatrick provided to me at your request included tabs for weather and crude . do you contemplate that netco would trade those commodities / products ? bob hall ' s team that he has assembled for netco does not include anyone with either weather or crude operations experience .
we retained two top - notch operations individuals - todd hall and kevin sweeney - who at this time are not on the list for netco . both have extensive risk management experience and both have also managed all aspects of trading operations - documentation , risk books and settlements . todd and kevin each are good managers and they are working managers who know how to execute the details .
todd has most recently been in charge of all aspects of operations for weather . prior to has role in egm , todd created the mpr and supported all daily activities around valuing the assets in that portfolio . he also has had extensive experience in gas risk management .
sweeney ' s most recent assignment has been to manage operations for eim . the bulk of his enron experience has been in crude and crude products . he was part of the original team that opened the singapore trading office and has experience in the uk as well .
if you anticipate dealing in commodities outside gas and power , todd and kevin would both be great players to have on the netco team .
let ' s discuss . - - sally
