enron currently has 8 interview rooms scheduled on december 11 , 2000 . . . as
we have 10 interview rooms available to us and as on 11 / 3 we currently have
nine rooms booked , if enron wants to move all 8 schedules to 11 / 3 , we
probably will not be able to host them on - campus unless [ the firm currently
holding the rooms ] moves off ( and there is a possibility of that - this is
like a game of dominos ) . however , enron could interview off campus , but
that is not as convenient for the students and it increases the cost for the
employer . if enron wants to move only one or two schedules to 11 / 3 for just
comp finance , we would find a way to accomodate them . our recruiting
coordinator , sally gould , will do everything she can to make this work for
enron . please suggest that enron re - contact her as soon as they know what
their preferences are . alison knows how to reach her .
