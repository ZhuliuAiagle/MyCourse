shirley ,
please find the below answers to the questions you had sent to judy .
financial times - vince ' s subscription does not exprire until january 4 , 2001
vince ' s subscription to power finance & risk - what you recieved was not a
renewal , it was for a free trial that began on june 5 th and ends on june 26 .
please disregard it . his subscription that we recently renewed does not
expire until march 26 , 2001 .
i have sent in payment for vince ' s renewal for oxford energy forum .
if there is anything else that i can help you with , please do not hesitate to
call me .
