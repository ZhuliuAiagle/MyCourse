Subject: re : billing question
thank you for your message . the credit card i want to use is currently stored
in your system . when i want to update the billing information with this card
number , i am getting the answer : credit card already in use . the card is in
good standing and there is absolutely no problem with this card and there was
never any problem . i don ' t understand why your system failed . i think that
this is your problem , not mine .
discover
last 4 digits : 0057 .

sincerely ,

p . s . i have just called discover and was told the account is in pefect shape
( as expected ) . as i have said , you must have a bug in your system .
