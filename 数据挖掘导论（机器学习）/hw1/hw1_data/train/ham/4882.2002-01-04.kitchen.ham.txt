Subject: netco - ercot
louise , attached please find our ercot business plan for your review . doug and i have jointly put together a trading / marketing detailed plan to get ercot restarted as quickly as possible . we have separated the plan in three tiers to prioritize tasks and customers in order to expedite earnings for early 2002 .
one thing you should note is that in ercot we will not need a ferc power marketing license to start trading physical power due to texas not being regulated by ferc . therefore if there is a drag on obtaining the ferc license , ercot should be in the lead for regions getting restarted .
let me know your thoughts .
thanks , - mike
