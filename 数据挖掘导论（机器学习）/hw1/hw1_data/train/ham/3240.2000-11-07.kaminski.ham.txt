vince ,
i understand that you or someone in your group had a demo from the above
group last friday . i was wondering if this was part of a push to bring more
options ' analytics to the traders ' desks , and if so , if you could explain
what that effort looks like ? one of the global markets traders , mario de la
ossa also had a look at the software as he has used it in the past .
thanks ,
kevin
