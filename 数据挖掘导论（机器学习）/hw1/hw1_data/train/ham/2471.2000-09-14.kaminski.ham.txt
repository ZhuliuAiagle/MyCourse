toni ,
i spoke with ben today and he is planning to pay for a trip to bring his
wife to houston this weekend and show her around in hopes of overcoming her
hesitiation on moving . his question is whether enron will give him the time
to bring her down here and then give an answer next week ? if you will let
me know how you , grant , and vince feel about that .
thanks ,
mike
