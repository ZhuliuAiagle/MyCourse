these changes are consistent with providing a strong enron relationship at the top of the organization . dick will be stepping down in the next few quarters due to mandatory retirement . bill morrow ( our stronghold ) is over all unregulated business ( enovate , power , retail , etc . ) and the utility gas supply function . don field the new president , is over the utilities ( operations , systems , etc . ) and is a 2 - 3 year assignment until bill morrow reaches " seniority " i . e . his 50 ' s .
these changes complement our objectives with pec in the following manner 1 ) upon dick ' s departure , tom wants to aggressively grow the company and imprint his direction / objectives , including taking the regulated assets into non - regulated business , m & a activity , and regaining ground on nicor 2 ) bill will now set the course for the retail business which will potentially provide enron the ability to leverage ees via peoples namesake in chicago 3 ) tom / bill ' s legacies are directly tied to growth in the non - regulated business which were provided the $ . 268 of eps from enron business . all other business at pec provided negative contributions .
