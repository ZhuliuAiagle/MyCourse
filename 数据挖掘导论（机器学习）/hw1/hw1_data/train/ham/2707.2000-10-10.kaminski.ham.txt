subject : exploration data as the root of the energy ( oil ) supply chain and
consulting
good morning vince :
1 ) we met with some geophysical data gathering / transmission people last
week . i observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of
the ( oil exploration ) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data
driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of
broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades .
i asked adler or reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation .
have they contacted you yet ?
2 ) i ' m converting to consultant - i ' ve had a great year here but need to get
back north more often ( family ) . i will be converting to consultant status
starting next week . do not hesitate to call me if there is anything i can do
for you or your team to help out .
