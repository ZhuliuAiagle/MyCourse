Subject: today ' s discussion
anjam , thanks for organising this - and vince thanks for making yourself
available for the discussion .
i am working for joe gold and my group is concerned with adding the web as an
additional sales and communication channel for our european business units .
through the web we are also able to convey a more local image , rather than
presenting ourselves as a texan company through enron . com .
to set you into perspective about what we have in mind i have attached a
brief presentation which has been the basis for the sign off of the project .
we intend to display a wide training section for the following reasons :
document our know - how base
educate the market participants
generate great stickiness ( participants should know that if they need to know
s . th . on energy risk mgt . they should go to enron )
later on : have the option to commercialise this area .
i look forward to our discussion .
kind regards
sven becker
