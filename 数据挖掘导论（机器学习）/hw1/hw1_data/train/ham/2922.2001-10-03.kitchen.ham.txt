chris :
with the $ 1 . 5 million to ship mhi turbines 1 and 2 , the summary of the numbers is the following :
therefore , we would be about $ 300 , 000 over the original dash . these numbers do not include transaction and financing costs . i will do a dash amendment and am copying louise on this email so that she is aware of what is going on . the storeage would be in a bonded warehouse , so no duties would be due at this time . on leads , we have a couple of new parties , but nothing concrete yet . ron has been working with one counterparty and may receive an offer in the near term .

the proposed plan on the mhi units is to ship units 1 and 2 to the us for storeage at a central location . the storeage costs are significantly less than proposed by mhi and the ability to centralize all of the shipments will be beneficial for a potential sale . from an economic perspective , it would be better if we had a sale in the short term and could ship directly . however , given a lack of any firm sale , the recommendation is to ship them to the us and store . let me know if you are in agreement with going forward with the shipment .
thanks ,
brett

? packing requirements to maintain warranty
? other requirements ( space heaters , etc . )
? inspection instructions
? plan to submit a request to mhi that the unit ( s ) be readied for shipment ( est . sept . 30 with written notice )
? carrier able to be at port of export by oct . 22 - 31
? estimate 32 days from port of export to port of import
please review and forward comments by tomorrow morning . i will formalize for a discussion with dave duran and ben jacoby prior to the mhi phone call ,
thanks , ron .

i would like to have a meeting today regarding the storage of mhi 501 f units 1 & 2 . we have received a proposal from mhi for these units to be stored in japan which is attached . i believe we have better options if mhi persists in their views on how the unit will be stored and enron is charged for these services . i would like for you to review and offer comments and suggestions . i have also attached the letter i sent to them outlining our requirements .
does anytime from 1 - 3 p work for everyone .
copy lorie leigh / lisa zarsky on your availability and they will coordinate a meeting for this afternoon .
thanks , ron .
