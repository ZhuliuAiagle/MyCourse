enron corp . , looking to convince wall street that it can cope with an escalating financial crisis , has held initial discussions with private - equity firms and power - trading companies for a capital infusion of at least $ 2 billion , people familiar with the matter say .
the houston energy concern , unable to tap the public capital markets at a time when it needs to shore up its balance sheet , has approached such big - name buyout firms as blackstone group and clayton , dubilier & rice to gauge their interest . enron seeks a cash infusion in exchange for an equity stake in enron , among other terms . in addition , a number of companies involved in power trading , a core business for enron , have expressed an interest in making an investment . the identity of the companies making overtures couldn ' t be determined . prominent energy companies with power - trading operations include anglo - dutch oil concern royal dutch / shell group , dynegy inc . , duke energy corp . , of charlotte , n . c . , reliant energy inc . , of houston , and el paso corp . , also of houston . another well - known investor from outside the industry was approached but declined enron ' s offer .
enron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to raise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expected . mostly , though , it needs to restore its credibility with wall street at a time when its access to the financing markets is drying up . one potential financier is general electric co . ' s ge capital unit , which also has been approached by enron . ge , of fairfield , conn . , has no interest in an outright takeover of enron , but it could take on a small stake or make a financing commitment and it has had discussions to that effect , according to one person familiar with the matter . ge declined comment .
" you would expect everybody that is in the business and understands power trading would make a phone call , " one person familiar with the matter said . a capital infusion would be one way to help restore enron ' s credibility with wall street , as it would show that the so - called smart money is willing to bet on a turnaround . enron chairman kenneth lay is eager to secure a deal as early as this week , these people say .
an enron representative declined to comment , as did a spokesman for dynegy . spokesmen for blackstone and clayton , dubilier & rice declined comment .
enron has been rocked by last month ' s disclosure of a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by enron ' s former chief financial officer . last month , it reported a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million . the securities and exchange commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter . last week , enron secured $ 1 billion in new credit lines , using gas - pipeline assets as collateral .
enron ' s stock price has tumbled in line with the developments , falling more than 60 % since mid - october . at 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading , enron was down 13 cents at $ 11 . 17 .
yesterday , ratings concern fitch inc . downgraded enron ' s senior unsecured debt to triple - b - minus from triple - b - plus . enron ' s senior unsecured debt now is rated just a notch above junk bond , or high - yield , status . last week , standard & poor ' s corp . lowered its credit rating on enron to triple - b , while moody ' s investors service lowered its rating to baa 2 .
given such high - profile problems , the declining stock price and potential for further sec action , any investors likely would insist on a close scrutiny of enron ' s finances and may seek board seats in exchange for a stake . one potential investor said his firm was unlikely to make a commitment unless enron offered terms that were too good to pass up .
" it is inherently risky to invest in a company that is under investigation , when the outcome of that investigation is unknown , " said joel papernick , a partner in new york at mintz , levin , cohn , ferris , glovsky and popeo , a law firm that isn ' t involved in the matter .
any transaction likely would take the form of a convertible - preferred stake , in which an investor receives a safe , bond - like interest payment and then can convert that holding into common stock after the share price rises to a specified level . it also is possible that enron would enter such transactions with more than one party . for instance , a $ 2 billion investment may be too big for one private - equity firm , so enron may need to get a couple of potential investors on board . another way to shield an investor ' s risk could be for a private - equity firm to invest in an asset owned by enron instead of investing in the parent company .
analysts are divided as to whether enron will seek an investment from a private equity firm or a company that already is in the power - trading business . some analysts say the most logical investor would be someone who already understands the deregulated energy markets that enron helped pioneer . there also are social factors that could influence whose infusion of cash , ultimately , is accepted .
dynegy long has been regarded as an enron " wannabe , " because it has a history of following moves that enron has made . after enron purchased the portland general electric utility in 1997 , dynegy made a successful bid to buy illinova corp . which it acquired in february 2000 . after enron launched its successful internet - based commodities trading platform , enrononline , in november 1999 , dynegy developed its rival dynegydirect platform .
one big difference between the two companies is that enron has pursued an " asset light " strategy in recent years , trying to control the output of gas fields and power plants without actually owning them . dynegy has been much more comfortable owning hard assets and was a big purchaser of power plants in california in 1998 , for example .
the two companies , with headquarters in downtown houston , are seen as die - hard rivals . that could make it difficult for mr . lay to accept any overture from dynegy chairman chuck watson . dynegy ' s largest single investor is chevrontexaco corp . , of san francisco , which has profited handsomely from a 28 % equity stake in dynegy .
an overture from coral energy , royal dutch shell ' s marketing and trading unit , might receive a more receptive response from enron , some onlookers say .
coral isn ' t one of the biggest energy traders , but it carries a triple - a rating that is unusual for an energy - trading concern . coral acts as the exclusive marketer of shell ' s north american natural - gas production , as well as for the power generation , gas pipeline and gas - storage assets controlled by intergen , a joint venture of shell and bechtel group inc . , the big san francisco engineering and consulting firm .

announced plans to raise cash by selling assets have slowed , the
paper said . an investment by a private - equity firm could restore
the company ' s credibility with wall street , the paper reported .

convertible - preferred stake that would pay them interest , like a
bond , and yet could still be traded for stock once the share price
rises to an agreed target , the journal said .
analysts are split between those that think enron want a
private equity firm to invest and those that say enron will opt
for a company in the same business , the journal reported .

partnerships run by its former chief financial officer . the
partnerships bought and sold enron shares and assets , with the
trades costing enron $ 35 million and $ 1 . 2 billion in lost

pg & e corp , the owner of pacific gas & electric , yesterday said that wholesale power prices had stabilised in california , and its reorganisation was progressing well .
this suggests the worst might be over in the state ' s power crisis , which sent prices soaring and dragged pg & e into bankruptcy .
enron , the us energy trader , which is among pg & e ' s 30 , 000 creditors and is owed $ 500 m , also said recently that the california situation was improving .
pg & e filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in april after it amassed nearly $ 9 bn in debt by buying power on the open market at sharply higher prices that it could not pass on to customers .
pg & e corp yesterday said that the cost of buying electricity for pg & e dropped 69 per cent to $ 697 m in the third quarter , from $ 2 . 23 bn a year ago .
the average price of power in california is 75 per cent lower than in the year - ago quarter .
" prices have stabilised as we predicted they would . if customers can see the true cost of power then they will regulate themselves , " said a pg & e corp spokesman .
" now , usage is down and prices have come down , " he added .
the lower electricity costs helped pg & e corp to more than treble its third - quarter net income to $ 771 m , or $ 2 . 12 a share , from $ 225 m , or 62 cents a share a year ago .
sales fell 16 per cent to $ 6 . 3 bn , from $ 7 . 5 bn .
peter rigby , utilities analyst at standard & poor ' s , the credit rating agency , yesterday said that there was " guarded optimism " that the trend of lower wholesale prices would continue .
pg & e corp said it hoped to learn before the year - end that its restructuring plan filed in september was " reasonable " . the plan is to split the parent and the utility into stand - alone companies , with the transfer of some assets to pg & e ' s unregulated units .
ratepayers , however , fear that such a move would take pg & e as well as another utility , southern california edison , out of the oversight of the state regulatory body , the california public utilities commission ( cpuc ) .
kenneth lay , chairman of enron , said recently that a settlement with the cpuc to keep edison out of bankruptcy was good news for the california power situation .

dabhol power company , the indian arm of the troubled enron energy group , yesterday moved closer to abandoning its role in a controversial $ 2 . 9 bn power project near bombay .
dpc said it was preparing to hand over the 2 , 184 mw asset to its sole customer , maharashtra state electricity board , and would demand compensation based on an independent valuation .
bankers said that , under the terms of the contract , mseb was obliged to buy the distressed asset because it had defaulted on payments , the cause of a breakdown in relations between the two parties .
yesterday mseb said it refused to take " cognisance " of dpc ' s issue of a " notice of asset transfer " because the indian company had withdrawn from the contract six months ago , an act of defiance which dpc says was invalid .
mseb ceased taking power from the plant in may , alleging contractual misrepresentation . phase one of the complex is complete and the second stage was approaching completion before the dispute effectively killed off work .
" this notice formally sets in motion the valuation process of dabhol ' s assets in connection with the termination of the power purchasing agreement , " dpc said yesterday .
the us company ' s initiative yesterday comes days before it can legally issue a final termination notice on the $ 2 . 9 bn power project and amid a flurry of financial diplomacy by the project ' s indian and foreign lenders to salvage the country ' s biggest foreign direct investment .
indian financial institutions , which carry a large exposure to the project as lenders and as guarantors of foreign loans , are under pressure to find a solution ahead of the visit by atal behari vajpayee , indian prime minister , to washington this week .
enron ' s move runs parallel to efforts by kenneth lay , chairman of the houston - based company , to seek full compensation of about $ 1 bn for itself and two smaller us equity holders , general electric and bechtel . the fourth and final equity holder is mseb , which holds a 15 per cent stake .

the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) today served a notice of asset transfer on the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) . this notice is a precursor to issuing a final termination notice ( ftn ) to the board and
formally kicks off the process of valuation of dpc ' s assets , a statement issued by the company said .
dpc had secured the permission of its lenders for serving the transfer notice in early october . the transfer notice is yet another step in the enron saga following its payments dispute with mseb .
dpc had served a preliminary termination notice in may , 2001 and mseb had retaliated by rescinding the power purchase agreement ( ppa ) and refusing to buy power . after the serving of the preliminary notice , there was a cooling off period of six months . this was to give the two sides enough time to arrive at an amicable solution , failing which a ftn has to be served .
" dpc would still prefer to resolve this dispute amicably through negotiated purchase by the indian government and financial institutions of the foreign sponsors ' equity , including offshore lenders ' debt . however , ongoing discussions between dpc , the indian government and fis are yielding no significant progress toward a fair and reasonable solution . consequently , dpc is left with little choice other than to serve the transfer notice to mseb , which draws us closer to final termination of the ppa , " the dpc statement added .

bombay , nov 6 ( afp ) - united states - based enron corp ' s indian subsidiary said tuesday it will serve a final termination notice to officially close a controversial power project in india ' s western maharashtra state .
the dabhol power company ltd . ( dpc ) , will serve the notice to the mahrashtra state ' s electricity board ( mseb ) after november 19 when the six - month deadline for resolving a payment dispute ends , an enron official told afp .
enron holds a 65 - percent stake in dpc , which set up the 2 . 9 billion dollar power project - - the single largest us investment in india .
the mseb is a stakeholder in dabhol power company .
the 2 , 1984 - megawatt plant stopped generating electricity in the middle of last year after the mseb , its sole client , failed to clear its long - overdue bills .
mseb also later refused to buy any more power following a dispute over tariffs .
enron served on monday an " asset transfer notice " to mseb for the valuation of company ' s plant and machinery , in order to sell these off .
" we will now appoint a valuer to value the assets and then transfer them to mseb for the price that the valuer arrives at .
" it ( enron ) was left with no choice other than to serve the transfer notice as the ongoing discussions with the government of india , indian financial institutions are yielding no significant progress toward a fair and reasonable solution , " he added .
in a statement dabhol power said the asset transfer notice follows more than two years of late payments and defaults in payments from the electricity board and a repudiation of the power purchase agreement by the board .
it said : " following the transfer notice , the final termination notice is likely to be served in the near future to continue the legal process against the board . "
enron and the government are in talks to sell dabhol power to the government .
indian state - owned financial institutions have lent 1 . 4 billion dollars to the project , while foreign lenders have an exposure of 600 million dollars .
loans by foreign lenders are guaranteed by the federal government , but the indian lenders do not have the same cover .
foreign lenders in may this year authorised the power company to issue a preliminary termination notice to mseb after payment defaults .

seven oil - services , drilling firms record 10 % share - price hit last week .

( c ) 2001 energy intelligence group . all rights reserved .
shares of many leading energy companies suffered sharp share - price declines last week amid a drop in the broader equity market and falling crude oil prices .
the dow jones industrial average fell 2 . 3 % to close at 9 , 323 on friday , following a gloomy week for broad economic fundamentals . the us department of commerce announced that the us economy shrank by 0 . 4 % in the third quarter - the first quarterly drop in economic growth since first - quarter 1993 - and the department of labor reported that us unemployment soared to 5 . 4 % last month , up from 4 . 9 % in september .
concerns about the faltering economy created anxiety about crude oil demand . the price of front - month light , sweet crude on the new york mercantile exchange ( nymex ) closed at $ 20 . 18 / barrel on friday , down nearly $ 2 / bbl on the week ( od nov . 5 , p 3 ) .
us natural gas prices continued to firm , with front - month henry hub prices on the nymex closing at $ 3 . 24 / million btu , up 20 ? on the week .
although gas prices rose , the drop in oil prices caused some oil - services and drilling companies to give back some of the big gains they had recorded the prior week ( od oct . 30 , p 6 ) . halliburton , pride international , noble drilling , petroleum geo - services , ensco international , schlumberger , transocean sedco forex , and global marine each saw their shares fall by 10 % or more last week ( see table ) .
still , corporate news was the catalyst for the biggest share - price losers . houston - based genesis energy , which operates crude oil pipelines and is an independent gatherer and marketer of crude , suffered the worst drop , at 37 . 5 % . the sharp decline was precipitated by news that the limited partnership would reduce quarterly distributions from 20 ? to 10 ? due to a credit crunch .
unsurprisingly , houston - based energy trading giant enron was near the top of share - price losers list for last week . the stock has been in a free - fall since early october due to a rash of news that included the departure of two top executives and the revelation of serious balance sheet problems . last week , enron shares plunged by nearly 27 % after credit ratings agency moody ' s downgraded the company ' s corporate credit rating and provided a gloomy outlook for its future ( od nov . 5 , pl ) .
among last week ' s stock winners , troubled norwegian service firm kvaerner topped the list with a gain of about 24 % . kvaerner shares jumped after the company agreed to a financial reorganization plan with its biggest shareholder , russian major yukos , and its top creditors ( od oct . 31 , p 6 ) .
cms energy saw its shares rise by about 7 % on the back of higher gas prices and the sale of its gas operations in equatorial guinea to marathon for nearly $ 1 billion in cash ( od nov . 5 , pl ) .

enron credit web site lists no rating for enron corp .

new york - ( dow jones ) - enron credit is a web site created by enron corp . ( ene ) to help provide traders with tools to hedge against credit exposure - except , it seems , when it comes to trading in enron .
the enron - operated site tracks more than 10 , 000 companies , giving each a rating known as the " enron cost of credit . " the rating is expressed as an interest rate , and a higher rate indicates increased credit exposure .
previously , enron ranked itself among the companies for which it provides data , but a recent trip to the site showed that when asked for enron ' s own cost of credit , the site was " temporarily not showing prices for this company . "
why no listing for enron ?
" the situation is too fluid , " said an enron spokeswoman . she said it was common for enron credit analysts to stop listing a company when its credit situation is " volatile . "
other companies currently not listed by the service include pg & e corp . ( pcg ) , the parent of bankrupt california utility pacific gas & electric co . , and compaq computer corp . ( cpq ) , which is being acquired by hewlett - packard co . ( hwp ) .
the spokeswoman said she didn ' t know when enron ' s listing had been pulled from the site , or what its last posted rating was .
however , not all references to enron were pulled .
according to the web site ' s graphing section , which charts the cost of credit for companies over time , the average cost of credit for companies in the gas sector is 1 . 07 , but enron ' s own cost of credit is listed at 8 . 51 for the same period . this is based on a three - year liability .
by comparison , enron ' s rivals in the merchant energy marketing and trading arena have sharply lower rankings . for example , dynegy inc . ( dyn ) weighs in at 1 . 26 , while el paso corp . ( epg ) is at 1 . 90 , and williams cos . ( wmb ) at 1 . 38 .
the enron spokeswoman was surprised to discover the listing and said it was appearing " by mistake . " she confirmed the information was accurate . enron is updating its rating internally .
enron credit under microscope
enron ' s credit has been under the microscope since the company posted a third - quarter charge of more than $ 1 billion to write off some failed investments . the company also later disclosed an additional $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholders ' equity caused by the early termination of controversial outside partnerships run by its former chief financial officer andy fastow .
in the weeks that followed the disclosure , enron ' s credit rating was first downgraded by moody ' s investor service , and then by standard 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com
