steve ,
risk will give you more exposure in the peer group faster .
shan left ( i think they are firing people at risk - a normal development
for a successful company that got ahead of itself ) .
if risk does not work , i shall talk to phelim about speeding the publication .

hi vince
the person i was dealing with ( shan millie ) passed on my paper to her
successor , and i ' ve heard nothing since . the plan was to try and publish the
article in risk ' s " game choices " real options book , which is being published
in june , along with a summary version for the magazine .
i ' m supposed to be waiting for them to get back to me , and it ' s not been at
the front of my mind until now . i think i ' ll chase them up .
interestingly at a recent risk course phelim boyle expressed an interest in
my work to appear in one the the journals he edits , i think it ' s decision
science or something like that . do you think this would be a more
appropriate home for the work ?
one more thing that may be of interest to you is that i ' ve now worked forward
recursive dp into my notation too . it ' s simply a matter of putting the
decision nodes on the left hand side of the value symbols !
should i chase risk , or pursue the peer reviewed phelim boyle option ?

i ' d like to give a talk entitled " diagrammatic representation of real options
in enron " , in which i will give a brief run - down of a diagrammatic technique
i have developed for representing real option deals . my notation allows
originators , managers and quants to communicate unambiguously , while still
appreciating the complexity and subtlety of real optionality . i have defined
a " diagrammatic grammar " which guarantees that the pricing of the deal
follows immediately and automatically from the diagram .
i propose to introduce the symbols and grammar , then go on to present some
suitable examples of diagrams . if appropriate i ' ll talk about the links with
dynamic programming . ( i will need some guidance as to how much technical
detail i can go into based on the audience . )
all the best ,
