Subject: re : houston research opportunity
tara :
thanks for the update . it seems anjam is playing hard ball a little . my
initial reaction is to be inflexible because it is a good offer , but on
second thoughts , could you please give me an idea of what is meant by a
12 - month assignment when you have a moment ? compensation , benefits ,
responsibilities , career path implications , etc .
many thanks !
regards ,
grant .
