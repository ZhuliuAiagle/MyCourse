mike ,
i work for enron transportation and storage in their storage marketing
group . my group has been using technical analysis from your website to help
make daily storage trading revenue decisions . on your web site , you
indicated you would be discontinueing some of the information we use . we had
interviewed external technical service profiders , and chose not to buy their
service because we had your information available to us to help us make
financial decisions . specifically , we need the candlestick charts and
analysis on natural gas , and we also need the elliot wave analysis on natural
gas .
can you please reconsider your decision to discontinue the technical analysis
data aforementioned ?
