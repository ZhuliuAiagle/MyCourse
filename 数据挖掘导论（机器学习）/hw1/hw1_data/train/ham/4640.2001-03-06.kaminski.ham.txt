gracie ,
does enron have any statistics classes ? ones more focused on basic
statistics and the lingo ( ex : alpha , beta , delta - gamma , type i & ii error ,
distributions , kurtosis , etc . ) than the var class ?
i have not seen any in the class schedule . in working with traders and
studying risk mangement concepts , even our " experts " that know almost
everything about marketing and modeling risk management products do not seem
to have an adequate understanding of basic statistics ! ! ! this lack of
knowledge basically makes my job as a fundamentals analyst ( researching the
underlying commodity markets for the purpose of maximizing egm / ea / eim
profits ) very inefficient .
if they already do not exist , i recommend that ernie institute two types of
statistics classes ( which mirror the existing finance class selection ) .
" introduction to statistics " ( perhaps a database approach - including
application to excel ? ) and " applied statistics " ( which would be a more
advanced approach that specifies how enron uses - or should use - statistics
in risk management marketing ) .
please let me know what you think .
cordially ,
anthony sexton
