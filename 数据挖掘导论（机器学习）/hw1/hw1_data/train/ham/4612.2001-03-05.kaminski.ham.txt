Subject: freese notis
mike :
we are currently being billed for freese notis weather . i will need to
allocate these charges to the appropriate cost center . if you would like to
continue this service i could allocate it directly to your cost center or
send you the bill directly . if you know of anyone else who uses this
application please let me know and i will split the cost among the
departments .
thank you ,
