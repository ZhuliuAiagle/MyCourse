dorie ,
tim belden and i are looking into chartering a plane to fly 8 people from portland . the cost is approx $ 20 k . commercial flights require two legs to vail or a flight to denver plus the drive . either would take 5 - 7 hours each way . lavorato said this was ok so long as we did not " break the bank " on the charter .
