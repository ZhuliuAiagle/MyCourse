i guess by your response , bob ' s group ( or some subset ) remains intact ? if so , we can cover with his group . rimbau may be in his group already .
does the mexican group survive ? given the circumstances , we should consider going to tractebel and see if we can go ahead sell them the entire project . i bet the idb would be glad to be rid of us !
let ' s talk on monday when you get a chance .
