kevin presto wants to know if it ' s okay to take the office next to john ' s - 06102 ?
i received a call from a candice karpakis with williams company and she wanted a list of our trading group . she has done business with enron for 15 years and has worked closely with steve south on transportation on the northwestern pipelines . she would like the list so she knows who she should contact to do business . i told her i would need to get approval before i could send anything . what are your thoughts on this ?
i did an expense report for you but it ' s only $ 314 so i thought i would wait and see if you had any additional expense i could add .
i packed your files and sent them to don miller . i put a list of the files that were sent on your wall behind your monitor .
i will have my cell phone with me so please do not hesitate to call me .
