Subject: re : tom halliburton
dear all :
a few words about tom . he is a power engineer type who has previously worked
at northwestern us and new zealand utilities on various projects including
asset planning and hydro scheduling . he was hired by ei structuring to
oversee modeling efforts using sddp , henwood , etc . because of the recent
implosion at ei apache , tom ' s group has effectively evaporated , and thus he
is looking for a new home . he has some finance background from having to
do asset evaluation for utility rate filings . he has almost no options
experience . he seems to have quite a bit of experience in some classes of or
problems .
clearly the most obvious fit is with my group , but the idea is for you all to
see if tom has a tool set that may be of use to other research projects .
and , as usual , the personality fit is the other aspect to examine .
this is meant to be casual . if the consensus is positive , then i will explore
the formalities of such a transfer .
thanks ,
grant .
