subject : enron , case study at nordic business schools
dear mark ,
i want to thank you for two very interesting days and a very pleasant
evening in london at the european pr conference .
as you may remember from the session " ideas forum " , i presented an idea of
introducing enron ' s transformation from an " old " industry / energy company to
an innovative player in the " new " economy as a case study at the leading
nordic business schools . i have later discussed the idea with enron ' s head
of the nordic region , thor lien . he agrees that this could be a good way of
raising the awareness of enron in the nordic business community . one reason
for this is that several professors of the nordic business schools are
frequent speakers at business conferences , they are very often sought by
business reporters to give comments etc . if enron becomes a " top of mind "
innovative company with these professors , it will help relation - building and
pr work towards the business community .
i understood from you that some us business schools have developed similar
( ? ) case studies on enron . do you or someone else in enron have access to
such case studies ? if so , would it be possible for you to send us copies ? it
would be a great help for us .
best regards ,
oddbjorn tysnes
