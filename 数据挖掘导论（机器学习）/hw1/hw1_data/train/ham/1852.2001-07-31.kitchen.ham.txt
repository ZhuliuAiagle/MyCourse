karen : i was out of town yesterday , and am just now getting your message . i will give you a call this morning to discuss . the thing that concerns me the most is the reference to " inside view " - - - - - if they have not talked to anyone at enron , or don ' t attribute the " inside view " to some credible former enron person , then it is misleading to call it an " inside view " . absent false statements or breaches of confidentiality , if this is nothing more than someone ' s opinion of enron and how it operates , then we probably can ' t stop them ( i ' m surprised that there is not more of this " stuff " ) . it would definately be helpful to get a copy of the report ( even if we have to pay for it ) ; without knowing what it says , it would be hard to say what action we can take . i will give you a call and we can discuss . thanks , rex .

rex - - apparently this organization is attempting to sell this report about enron that ' s purported to be an " inside view . " i called this morning and they never talked to anyone inside the company . the president of the company is supposed to call me back - - i want to get a copy of this report . but i wanted to send to you anyway . is there anything we can do to prevent them from marketing this ?
thanks !
