phil ,
the optimization engine is ready and the graphical user interface is almost
done . attached please find the updated network design optimization
specification . it contains some additions and modifications to the old
specification i sent you a while ago . the major changes are :
1 . the program now also supports ring design . and it can solve to optimality
2 . the graphical user interface is handled by visual basic on a pc . ( not on
the web browser as in the previous spec . ) .
please take a look at the specification document and let me know if there is
anything you want to add / change / remove . . . etc .
moreover , please do not forget to send us a test example .
we are buying cplex and will install it on our network . hopefully our it
teams can configure your machine to run it in a few weeks .
