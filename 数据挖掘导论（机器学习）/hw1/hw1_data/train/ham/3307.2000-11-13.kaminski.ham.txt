Subject: calendars and reviews
could all of you please give access to your calendars ( lotus organizer ) to
anita dupont , and also make sure that if you step away from your desk that
your calendar indicates where you will be ? it has happened a few times
recently that people have come for appointments and the person has been away
from his / her desk and anita could not get hold of the person . this does not
portray a good image of the group . also , if you have cell phones , please
make sure anita has the number .
also , please make sure to complete your self - assessment performance review ,
and either indicate list of projects worked on since june in there or at
least separately e - mail me a list .
thanks ,
vasant
