subject : dinner speaker - may 23
shirley ,
this is to follow up today ' s conversation with anita . as mentioned paul
kleindorfer invited vince to be our dinner speaker on thursday , may 24 . on
reflection given the strong line up for wednesday - fred kahn et al - we
would very much like vince to be the speaker on wednesday . this will
conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be
there for the wednesday .
i gather that this change should be acceptable to vince .
we will show vince ' s name as follows :
wincety j . kaminski
managing director - research
enron
jeremy will be em ailing you the program with this information immediately .
we would like to go to press today . failing that we can go to press
tomorrow . we would very much appreciate your confirming this and making any
corrections or changes . if you would respond to all of us it would be
appreciated .
