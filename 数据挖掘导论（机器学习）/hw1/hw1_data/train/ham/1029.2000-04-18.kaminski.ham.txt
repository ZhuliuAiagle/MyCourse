Subject: rdi conference - may 17 - 19 , 2000
hi ,
i ' d like to make a personal invitation to you to attend rdi ' s annual user
conference at torrey pines in la jolla , just north of san diego . we are
planning two sessions for gpcm users ( and prospective users ) which i think
you will find very interesting and useful . plus we are also going to
schedule individual sessions for those that would like them , as was quite
successful last year . the details are included in the attached word file
below . i ' ve also included the program in pdf format . the last page is a
signup form you can fill out and fax in to rdi if you haven ' t already done
so .
please let me and mike know how many are coming from your team . you can
reply to this e - mail to let us know .
looking forward to seeing you there .
i think it ' s going to be fun .
