Subject: budgeting / organizational
due to recent events , mixed messages are permeating on what is appropriate business protocol . specific to my activities i need the following clarification :
1 ) travel limitations - is there an unspoken move to limit travel and business expenditures ? is this business smart ( as i currently manage ) or specific to enron ' s current status ?
2 ) strategic asset development - i currently have no employees committed to this group , yet my prior group is transitioning to frank . do i have the continued authority to build a business which includes new employees , new infrastructure , etc . ? if i need to wait for some specific timeline ( 5 - 10 days ) , please give me a nod . especially during this time , i need to be busy / head down / about business . . .
i would appreciate your response .
thanx ,
laura
