vince / sally
it appears that the implied vol on this one is quite high . perhaps we can
lower our var using historical vols .
i would be happy to interview him . his resume does not appear to be
research - worthy by any stretch so i guess rac or ops might be a fit
should i forward his resume to tony vasut and bring him in to see a couple of
racs and a couple of ops as sort of a first exploratory interview ? ?
sally - pls advise your thoughts .
vince - is this the price of being a risk management rock star ?
