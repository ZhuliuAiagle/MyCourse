hi vince ,

i sent the attached for enron ' s approval to fiona grant , but haven ' t heard
back . ? in the contract that we signed it states that we need to seek
approval from enron if we want to use the company name . ? is there someone
else we should direct these requests ?
?
hope you are well .
