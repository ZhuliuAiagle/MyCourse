Subject: re : interview schedule for punit rawal
shirley : i have been in touch with punit over the past several week , and it
appears that february 2 nd would suit his schedule best for the visit . how
does that date look for vince and the others in the group who will be
interviewing him ?
stephanie cody , my new admin whom you met last week , will be contacting punit
to make his travel arrangements .

subject : interview schedule for punit rawal
hi molly :
punit rawal is a carnegie mellon student that kevin kindall and bob lee
interviewed back in december . we would like to bring him in for an
interview . he is definately a " trading support " prospect .
i forwarded his resume to john lavorato back in december and inquired
as to whether he would be interested in interviewing him or not , but have
had no response , except that he has not had a chance to look at his
resume yet .
vince originally said that either john or gary hickerson might be interested .
i did not send his resume to gary , maybe you can check with him ?
i am attaching the interview request form and his resume . thanks !
shirley
