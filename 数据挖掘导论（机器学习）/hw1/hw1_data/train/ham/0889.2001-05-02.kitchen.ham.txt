wes ,
i spoke with ljm ' s counsel regarding the hanover derivatives , and we are in agreement with enron ' s view regarding the settlement of the swap and the collar . that is , the put can be exercised for intrinsic , not extrinsic , value in the interim before maturity . sorry it took so long to resolve this matter .
