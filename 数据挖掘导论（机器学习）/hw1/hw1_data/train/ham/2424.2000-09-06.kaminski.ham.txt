Subject: re : d - g energy
karla ,
the wording you have below sounds reasonable as we would only use the code
for internal valuation purposes .
i also checked with vince regarding the issues we discussed by phone
yesterday . he would like to specify a 2 day response time for the software
support . also , he would like to specify that the payment schedule be : 50 %
at time of initial contract and 50 % at the time when the software is
released . this would give them an incentive to release the software before
the full year is over if they want to accelerate the payment .
thanks again for all the help ,

subject : d - g energy
stinson ,
while trying to put together the agreements for d - g energy , i have an
additional question :
i need to know exactly what yall plan to do with the source code once you
have it after the initial one year period is up ? there are still limitations
as to what you can do with it , so i will need to know so we can try to revise
the contract so that you will be legal .
for example , in the language regarding release of the source code from
escrow , it states that once you have the source code , you just have the
" right to use , copy and modify the source code , solely for our internal
purposes in connection with support , maintenance and operation of the
software " .
do yall plan to reverse engineer , decompile , etc ? do you plan on using any
of their code to create our own product ? if so - i think these are going to
be a problem . the latter would be an infringement issue , unless we were to
contract to do so .
please let me know more details of your plan so i can see how we need to
proceed in this area .
thanks ,
karla
