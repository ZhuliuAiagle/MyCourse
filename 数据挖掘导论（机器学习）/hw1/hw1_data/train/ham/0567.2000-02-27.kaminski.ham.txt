subject : re : march real options conference

this is a draft of what i was thinking of presenting . i was not planning to
go over any specific options or opas ( these are covered by confidentiality
clauses and i have to be careful from a competitive standpoint ) but to give
the audience a few of the " real world " applications and challenges . i
welcome any thoughts or comments .
