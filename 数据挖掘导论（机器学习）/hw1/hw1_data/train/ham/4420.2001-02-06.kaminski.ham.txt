subject : good news - cabinet approval for power trading
team : today union cabinet has approved the proposal of ministry of industry
to allow foreign equity participation in power trading . this was conveyed by
secretary ( power ) during his meeting with wade . in normal course , the
proposal was slated to be coming up for cabinet in next few weeks . keeping in
view the developments of dpc invoking state guarantee , perhaps cabinet has
hurried it up .
the exact proposal approved was - " to allow foreign equity participation
through automatic route upto 100 % for trading in power sector , subject to
prevailing laws . "
irrespective of urgency of this approval to us , the best thing is that we are
getting the approval without draft electricity bill , 2001 being finalised . as
most of you are aware , initially the proposal was stalled at fipb level
pending finalisation of electricity bill . then it has gone to group of
ministers who had taken a positive approach and now the cabinet has cleared
it .
now fipb either issue an approval to enron llc or advise us to avail
automatic route . we will have one of it , culminating great team work .
