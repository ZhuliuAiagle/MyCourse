Subject: re : programming for rdi model
michelle ,
the project is progressing . helen has done a great job , finding various flaws
in the initial design ( ken ' s design ) of the access table , and has been going
back
and forth with ken to modify the table . since helen can ' t devote full time to
this project ,
chris has hired a contractor , cecil stradford , to do the coding . i have
spoken with
cecil just now and he says no coding has been done yet . i am trying to
arrange
a meeting today with cecil , helen , christin ( the one who ' s overseeing coding
process in cecil ' s company ) and myself . will report back to you on what
is discussed in the meeting .
best ,
alex
