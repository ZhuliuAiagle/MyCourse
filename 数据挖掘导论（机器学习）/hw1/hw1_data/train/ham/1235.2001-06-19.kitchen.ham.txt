Subject: re : prc mtgs . for louise
tammie , sorry it has taken so long to respond . the meeting dates and times have been changing rapidly and i wanted to make certain the information was fairly firm . there are two additional meetings that louise will need to be aware of since she has individuals in power that will be reviewed . she can make the decision on whether she needs to attend either of these meeting . while i believe that the technical meeting should have adequate bu representation , if louise feels strongly that she would like to attend , she should contact jeanie slone x 53847 as soon as possible .
1 . the ena commercial support prc will be held this thursday , june 21 beginning at 2 : 00 pm in the cottonwood room at the hyatt .
commercial support specialists , sr specialists and managers will be reviewed .
if you have any questions or scheduling conflicts , please contact jeanie slone at x 53847 .
2 . the technical meeting for ena / egm has been combined w / eeos . the meeting will take two days . the schedule for the meetings is june 21 and 22 nd . further information will be forthcoming shortly .
