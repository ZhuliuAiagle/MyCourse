louise -
tammie has checked and all but one of your expense checks for 2001 have been cashed . tammie indicated that you should have received a check mid - september in the amount of $ 4 , 069 . 72 for your last expense reimbursement claim - this check has not been cashed as of yet .
do you still have it or would you like to have tammie get it reissued ?
thanks !
amy
