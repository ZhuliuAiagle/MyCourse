stinson and vince ,
please see wade ' s comments below . it is critical that we start the exercise
quickly , and as metioned , it should be structured so that dpc foot the bill .
also , as mentioned , please have them desist from using the word viability
with reference to dabhol .
regards ,
sandeep .

thanks sandeep . engagement needs to be structured so that dpc will pay for
this key study . have them address the study to dpc and invoice dpc .
second , on the cover , the reference is to " . . . . . . and dabhol plant
viability . " please instruct them to immediately cease discussions about and
use of term dabhol viability . they can use the term they use later on , which
is dabhol plant operations .
