Subject: re : real options
vince ,
thanks again for coming to austin to speak with my class . i am sure
that they appreciated hearing about the use of real options at enron , and i
think it was a very fine way to finish the semester .
along with my colleagues from finance , i appreciate the strong
support that enron has provided to the college of business administration .
we appreciate the relationship , and look forward to seeing you in austin
again next year .
