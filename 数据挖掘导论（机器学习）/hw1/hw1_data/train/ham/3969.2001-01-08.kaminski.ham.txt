vince ,
before leaving for india i just wanted to jot you this small reminder to talk
to jeff shankman on monday .
aside from myself , i wanted to remind you to talk about anshuman shrivastava ,
who is currently assistant manager in india , and has my recommendation for
promotion to manager . he is our point person on many dpc matters , and is
also the person i have used on most fuel related issues . he will be a real
asset to jeff when located in houston . sinc he is single , and quite young ,
it will not be a problem to move him here at short notice .
i will call you from india as soon as i get in . it will be monday evening in
houston at that time , so could you please jot me a note telling me what would
be a good number to call you on .
i look forward to working with the team in research .
thanks again ,
regards ,
sandeep .
