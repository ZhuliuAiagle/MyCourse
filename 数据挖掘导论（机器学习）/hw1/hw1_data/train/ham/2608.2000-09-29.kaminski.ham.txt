department .

i need some publicly available data that unfortunately is not available
here . ? it is basically the historical prices for price of oil , gas and gold
futures contracts and options .
?
again the data is strictly public info and not proprietary at all . ? let me
know if there is a central data person at enron who would be able to help . ?
all help will be of course gratefully acknowledged .
