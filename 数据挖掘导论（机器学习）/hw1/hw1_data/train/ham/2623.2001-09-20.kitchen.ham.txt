subject : puc votes to suspend direct access effective september 20 th , but continues to hold out threat of retroactivity
the commission suspended direct access effective september 20 th .
the decision orders the utilities to stop accepting dasrs for contracts executed after 9 . 20 . 01 .
but astonishingly , the language in the proposed decision states that the commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to july 1 . in short , that battle continues .
how the commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time .
the commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between dwr and the puc .
