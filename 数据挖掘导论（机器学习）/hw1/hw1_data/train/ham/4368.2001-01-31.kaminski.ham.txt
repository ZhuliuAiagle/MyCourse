Subject: candidate : howard information
vince - i spoke with london just now .
here is what i gather vuthy said about howard haughton .
1 . he wants a second - round ( another interview with enron ) - but , with high
officials ( senior management , this time ) .
2 . he didn ' t think the interviewers were understanding his technical
abilities and language .
good news : he ( howard ) wants to come back for another interview . i was lead
to believe it went well although , howard believes in protocol .
bad news : howard in on vacation now for 10 days .
sounds fairly good on the candidate debrief .
thanks , vince .
