there are 3 . 0 mm ats warrants in two tiers . one is a tier of 1 . 0 mm with an exercise of 1 . 10 cad that expires 3 / 2003 . the second is 2 . 0 mm with an exercise price of 0 . 85 cad that expire 9 / 2002 . the are valued using the black - scholes by shona wilson ' s group . the model is signed off on by jean mrha . ats is publicly traded . current value on the gl is $ 762 k usd . this is after a 3 rd qtr write down of $ 751 k usd . i would think they should contact shona ' s group if the model that is used to value the warrants does not capture the true value .

bit of an issue here . i had thought we were marking purely the intrinsic value of the options due to their illiquid nature . i really think we need to mark these down to real values unless we can prove out the value by selling a proportion of the warrants into the market .
we also clearly have a write down from the number on the balance sheet which is way too high .
please could you evaluate the warrants and come up with a proposal of how we deal with them .
thanks

louise ,
i do not think it is possible to begin selling the ats warrants at this time .
per the ats warrant certificate , the ats common shares issuable on exercise of the warrants may not be sold , transferred or otherwise traded until march 20 , 2002 . the warrants are also non - transferable except to an affiliate .
in addition , the ats warrants are valued daily using a black - scholes model . the spreadsheet with the result of the evaluation is attached . the current value of the warrants is $ 762 , 600 usd using the evaluation model . however , the current ats stock price on the canadian venture exchange is $ 0 . 97 c with an warrant exercise price of $ 0 . 85 c for the first 2 , 000 , 000 share tranche . the second 1 , 000 , 000 share tranche has an exercise price of $ 1 . 10 c . thus , the current value is considerably less than the black - scholes evaluation model is calculating .
