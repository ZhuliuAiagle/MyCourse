reasons for using outlook web access ( owa )
1 . once your mailbox has been migrated from notes to outlook , the outlook client will be configured on your computer .
after migration of your mailbox , you will not be able to send or recieve mail via notes , and you will not be able to start using outlook until it is configured by the outlook migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated . during this period , you can use outlook web access ( owa ) via your web browser ( internet explorer 5 . 0 ) to read and send mail .
please note : your calendar entries , personal address book , journals , and to - do entries imported from notes will not be available until the outlook client is configured on your desktop .
2 . remote access to your mailbox .
after your outlook client is configured , you can use outlook web access ( owa ) for remote access to your mailbox .
please note : at this time , the owa client is only accessible while connecting to the enron network ( lan ) . there are future plans to make owa available from your home or when traveling abroad .
