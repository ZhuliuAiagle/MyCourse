Subject: re : current drafts of highstar / ena documents
stuart ,
per our discussion of earlier this afternoon , i am forwarding a series of e : mails that contain the latest drafts of the three principal documents - - the spa , the asset management agreement , and the brokerage agreement - - as well as the schedules & exhibits to the spa . the spa and the schedules / exhibits are ena ' s latest drafts and the other two documents are aig ( milbank tweed ' s ) responses .
heather kroll and i plan to meet at bracewell tomorrow morning at 9 : 00 a . m . the aig / milbank folks are expected to arrive around 10 : 00 , and we believe you could provide valuable input should you be in a position to attend on such short notice .
as you will see from the milbank markups a number of significant issues remain . for example , their addition of ( ii ) to section 8 ( c ) of the brokerage agreement shows that aig has yet to agree that ect securities liability for performance defaults should be limited to termination .
its going to be an interesting week . glad to have your insight .
steve
