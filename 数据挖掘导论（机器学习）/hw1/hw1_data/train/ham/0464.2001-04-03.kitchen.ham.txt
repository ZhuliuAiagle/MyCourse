kevin ;
thanks for the time this morning . as i mentioned , after 6 + very successful
years at dell in program management , product management , and business
development , i ' m starting to consider the possibility of leaving . given my
experiences here , leveraging the power of commoditizing ( intel - based
servers ) markets , a natural next step is a company like enron . any
appropriate introductions would be greatly appreciated .
regards . . . msg
p . s . i ' ve also sent your name to ray bell at smartpipes . what they ' re
doing could be a natural complement to enron ' s efforts in the bandwidth
space .
