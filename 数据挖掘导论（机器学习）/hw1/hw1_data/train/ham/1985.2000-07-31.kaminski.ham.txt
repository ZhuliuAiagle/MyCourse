Subject: message 4
dear dr . kaminski ,
this is a message of discussing the problem in lacima ' s paper . i think that
glen dixon has told you there is a fault in the paper written by dr . clewlow
and dr . strickland . it is understandable to have some errors in their work .
people always make mistakes .
actually , i found the problem in appendix a of their paper . they can ' t prove
the eq . a 4 rigorously . there is something wrong in mathematical
interpretation . if you like , i can give you a full analysis of this problem .
ps : attached with their paper .
best regard
quentin
