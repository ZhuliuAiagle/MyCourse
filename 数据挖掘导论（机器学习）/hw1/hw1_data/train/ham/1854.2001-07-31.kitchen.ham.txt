Subject: allegheny problems - urgent
allegheny told us that we may be in default of the tolling agreement . as part of that agreement , we had an obligation to deliver security agreements by july 31 . we have fulfilled that obligation but now allegheny is saying that they are not in the appropriate form . legal believes that they do not have any basis for this claim . nevertheless this is a major problem given the exposure - we have commited to construct the project and to sell the project . i do not know if they are negotiating hard or trying to blow up the deal . we will likely need your time on this matter and we may need to respond quickly - possible fixes include modifying the ground lease in a way that would require us to take out the project lender on lvi .
