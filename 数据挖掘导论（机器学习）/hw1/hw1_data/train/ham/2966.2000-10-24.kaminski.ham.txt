bjorn , niamh clarke is going to come to houston from mon afternoon to friday
next week to work on nvar . she developed var models for mitsubishi and has
lots of experience in this area . can you please provide her with the best
people we can from research and rac so we can try and get a better
understanding and more confidence in our model . i ' m sure you agree with me
that if my group is going to make any progress we need to get this sorted .
thanks in advance .

i think we need to sit down and talk about developing reporting that will
show the risk in the books . at this point and time it can be derived , but
only if you know what to look for . i would appreciate if you had some time to
do so .

looking at these numbers i think the var model must be waaaaaaaaaay over
calcing something , most likely the spreads . the net and outright product
position are negligible . seems it would take one hell of a daily move to
loose 12 . 7 on these positions .
