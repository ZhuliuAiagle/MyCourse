Subject: re : hi
zeigham ,
we discussed two options ( not necessarily mutually exclusive ) :
1 . summer internship
2 . full employment .
are you interested exclusively in full employment ?
i need the answer asap , as we are going to discuss the additional summer
intern positions this afternoon .

subject : hi
vince :
it was very nice talking to you at the texas finance festival and i think
the telecom market that enron is entering is very interesting and very
lucrative . ? i would be very interested in working in that segment for enron .
?
however , i talked to sheridan about this oppurtunity and he said that it is
probably going to be another six months before i finish my dissertation . ? so
while i am definitely interested , the start date will probably have to be
around that time . ?
?
at any rate , it was a pleasure meeting you again and hopefully once i have
defended my dissertation ? we can discuss employment oppurtunities in greater
detail .
?
?
regards
