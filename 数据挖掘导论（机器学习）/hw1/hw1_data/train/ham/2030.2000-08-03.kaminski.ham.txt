Subject: software license
vince ( ii ) d - g is unable to provide effective technical support ; or ( iii )
if d - g agrees to release it sooner .
before i have our attorney add these things to the agreement , we need to
discuss the escrow situation . vince mentioned that you had suggested that
your attorney keep the software in escrow . is your attorney a u . s .
attorney ? it seems like i may have recalled that way back in march you might
have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney . is that the
same person ? does this attorney work for a large firm , small firm , or solo
practitioner ? basically , if you could just provides some additional
information about your attorney , i would appreciate it .
we normally would use an escrow company to put the software in escrow . we
have dealt with a company here in the u . s . called dsi technology . i will
check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney .
once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow ,
we will red - line the agreement to reflect such changes and e - mail it back to
you for your review .
i look forward to hearing from you .
