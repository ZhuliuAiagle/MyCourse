louise and john will be reviewing these early next week . since catherine is eligible and has a 1 rating i do not believe this will be an issue .
louise has requested that each manager write a brief statement about why the employee should be promoted . please submit it to me by noon tomorrow if possible . i apologise for the late notice . the need for a written summary just came up . if this is an issue , just let me know and we can resolve another way . thanks .
