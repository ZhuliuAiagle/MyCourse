of heaven " in which he interviews prominent business leaders . bob darden
is his name and he ' s a former journalist and nice guy . he would like to
contact ken lay about being one of his interviews . do you think this is
possible ? if so , could you give me an address / phone numbers that bob might
use to contact ken ' s secretary about setting up an interview ?
if this is in any way " not ok " please just say so .
see ya ,
john
