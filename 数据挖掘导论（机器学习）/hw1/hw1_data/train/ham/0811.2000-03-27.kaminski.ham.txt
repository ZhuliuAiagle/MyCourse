Subject: re : forecast rates !
hi vince ,
thank you for sending me the email from don reid regarding the turkey fx and
cpi curve . i received the same email last week and the request has been
taken care of . in fact , he had a very short time line for the request and
had subsequently used outside forecasts for the bid . if the deal goes
through rac , i ' m sure we ' ll get another request for the curve , but for now ,
don said that he doesn ' t need a forecast from us .
regards ,
farouk z . lalji
