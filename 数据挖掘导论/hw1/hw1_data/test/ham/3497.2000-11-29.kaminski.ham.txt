Subject: interview with enron
dear mr . kaminski ,
?
even though i cannot pass " official " interviews , i would like to discuss
with enron . i was really impressed by your presentation and i think i would
be a good fit for your firm .
?
i know that you ? will be soon recruiting on campus , maybe we could set up an
" informal meeting " . either give me a call at home ( 412 - 802 - 6429 ) or send me
an email at this address . i would appreciate though not to appear on
interview lists .
?
