lloyd ,
yes , this would be very useful . i was told that we should not do any official
business with
mg until july 15 . i don ' t want to violate those rules of engagement and go
beyond casual contacts .
after the 15 th all the stops are off .

subject : re :
no problem - i do think this could wait until mg are more closely integrated
in any case . a useful first step might be an email to relevant trading
staff at mg outlining briefly what maureen does and how she can provide a
service to them . would you like me to send her a list of potential people to
email ?

i think that we can arrange a few video conference meetings instead .
i don ' t see a justification for extending the stay over the weekend if we
have an alternative solution .

i met maureen yesterday and had a useful discussion on her role within
enron . i think it would be very helpful to promote the research group
function of the company , particularly given maureen ' s background , if she
could be introduced to some of the main traders down at mg . unfortunately
she won ' t have time to meet with mg unless we can schedule some meetings on
monday .
would you be happy for her to extend her stay here till monday to allow the
meetings to take place ?
