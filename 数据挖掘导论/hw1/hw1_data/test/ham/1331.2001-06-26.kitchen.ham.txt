notes
? position roll - up process hangs sometimes in the production environment . this bug has been fixed in the parallel environment . the developer is now applying the fix to the production code .
? the performance of loading curve to the position manager has been improved in the parallel environment . the same change will be applied to the production code .
? we need to look into the current way of computing curve shift for gas daily options because it creates a large second order amount .
