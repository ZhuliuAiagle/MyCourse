we received two financing commitment letters from hancock . in general , the letters are good and suggest that hancock is genuinely in the deal , but they include some flakey language about not having final committee approvals . chip is going to push them a little more and if necessary get hancock to call ben glisan to assure us that they are in ( hancock wants a lot of future business from enron ) . in the meantime , we are innovatively stalling ge by requiring some consent language up front so we get another day from them . i think we will get both sides of this trade done .
