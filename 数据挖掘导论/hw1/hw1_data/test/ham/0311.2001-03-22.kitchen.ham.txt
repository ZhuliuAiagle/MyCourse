karen ,
thanks so much ; i will touch base with greg before saturday to provide him
with additional details and logistics .
actually , one of our advisory board members at genesis park , paul hobby ,
submitted his name as a nominee . obviously , jeff is one of those leaders
that comes to everyone ' s mind when you think of the power of ecommerce and
the internet !
we appreciate your support and will get you copies of photos from the event
as well as press coverage that is received .
best regards ,
gary
