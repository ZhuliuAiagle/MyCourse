subject : transmission line project - abb agreement
re - sending with minor changes to the prior documents . a clean copy is now provided .
lance schuler advised me that it is now jeff donahue , rather than mark metz , that needs to sign off on corp ' s behalf , and that either tim detmering , louise kitchen or john lavorato can approve on behalf of ena .
> >
a redraft of the abb confidentiality / exclusive dealings agreement is attached for review and comment .
this document is based on the form abb provided and for which abb has expressed a strong preference .
this draft calls for bilateral exclusivity for the term ( 2 years ) . as several of us have discussed , this will prevent ena from choosing an alternative technology or supplier during that time should it choose to construct a dc transmission line within a 15 - mile radius of san francisco . as i understand it , we are prepared to link arms with abb to do this project because abb is the premier supplier of this type of equipment .
based on recent discussions between wayne and abb , the language necessary for creating the exclusivity arrangement has been added to the form of confidentiality agreement that we had been working on with abb earlier . the added language is somewhat lengthy , but was necessary to establish the relationship and at the same time protect ena against arguments that we are obligated to proceed with the potential transaction .
because this transaction does commit ena to exclusivity obligations i understand that we will need to talk with tim detmering and mark metz about the transaction .
please let me know of comments .
