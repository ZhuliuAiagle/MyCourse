Subject: shalesh
jim ,
clarification regarding shalesh ' transfer to ebs .
the request to rotate shalesh out of research into ebs
came from ravi thuraisingham . my understanding was that it was
fully coordinated with you and i was more than happy to oblige .
shalesh is concerned that his integrity is being questioned and i can assure
you that he was not the instigator of the move .
my impression is that shalesh is doing a very good job and ravi is very happy
him . i shall be glad to keep him in the research group in his current role .
have a good 4 th of july .
