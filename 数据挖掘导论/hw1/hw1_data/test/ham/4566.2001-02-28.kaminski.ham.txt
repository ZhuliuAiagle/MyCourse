Subject: financial mathematics grad from u of c
vince and ravi ,
below is a message from the student whose resume i forwarded to you earlier
this week . vince , i suspect he may be best suited for your group , but i
don ' t know what your current needs are . unfortunately , i ' m leaving enron and
my last day is friday of this week , so i won ' t be around to help this guy
through the process or host him when he is here . can either of you suggest
someone i can ask to handle this for you if you ' re interested in him ?
thanks .
regards ,
laura
