" proposed generation webmap "
this site was developed to support our in - house research of proposed gas - fired generation in north america . it has been met with great delight and is used heavily by our gas and power originators . basic fields in the proposed database include ( company name , pipeline , size , merchant capacity , comments , city , county , state , on - line year , month . . . ) .

" pseudo real - time available pipeline capacity map "
this site was developed as a prototype , we basically took a pipe in the pacific northwest ' pgt ' and have linked to it available pipeline capacity for points along the pipeline . we have further plans to provide this for all the delivery / receipt point in the us . it has been a big hit and the traders are looking forward to having access to the entire system . fields in the database include ( pipe name , point name , total capacity , utilized capacity , available capacity ) the points are displayed by size according to the amount of available capacity that point holds . this one may take a minute to pull up .

real - time container available map "
this site was developed to support our freight capacity traders in " enron global markets " it reads freight capacity off of an external website and then displays that information on our website . again , the point ' s size is determined by the amount of capacity available at the point . if you identify the point you will see that the records are actually broken down by capacity type , the sum of these equals the total capacity of the points .

" diesel price map "
this site was developed for the egs fundamentals group that study volatility of diesel prices in the u . s . the point colors represent the price / gallon of diesel at different locations in the u . s . the webmap is designed to read very similar to a weather map , with the cool colors representing lower prices and so - on and so - forth . the site also includes a delta price ( + or - number in blue ) this delta number is the change is diesel prices since the most recent monday . this allows the traders to analyze relative volatility of prices . i have also included a . pdf file that basically represents the same information .
