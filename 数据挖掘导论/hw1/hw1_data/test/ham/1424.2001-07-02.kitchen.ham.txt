can you three get together and come up with a strategy for all the turbines and let me have some sort of summary document .
i am assuming that you three own the turbine book ( 33 . 3 % each ) and have the following turbines ( let me know if i have forgotten any ) .
i would also like to see the outline of terms under which ( i ) the transfer of the abb turbines from canada and ( ii ) , the terms under which brett participates in the turbine book . ( you ' ll need to agree all this by thursday , i will give you transfer number on friday for the abb turbines if one is not included in the report ) .
you guys need to discuss this together and please get me the information on thursday ( let me know if you want to discuss it or will just email me a copy ) .
thanks
