Subject: security question
dear guys
having been out of the office for a couple of days , i ' ve found myself the
victim of theft ( again ) . this time my desk drawer key has been stolen from
its " hiding place " under my telephone . i * always * lock my drawers and keep
the key in the same place , but on arriving in the office today i found the
drawers unlocked , and the key missing . although there ' s nothing sensitive on
or around my desk , i ' m concerned about the security implications of someone
sniffing around the office in this manner . i also found the papers on my
desk extensively reshuffled last week .
last year , in our old office , i had my only two real options books stolen
from among the many and varied books on my desk . that couldn ' t have been a
random theft , and i fear this isn ' t either . i can ' t understand who ' d be so
interested in a research guy ' s belongings !
can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious
activity around my desk ?
cheers ,
steve
