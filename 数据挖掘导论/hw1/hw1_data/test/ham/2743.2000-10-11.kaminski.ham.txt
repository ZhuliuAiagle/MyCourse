all
following discussions between matt , vince kaminski , and me , matt has decided
he ' d like to make a longer - term commitment to research . with this in mind
we ' d like to request that matt is switched from a & a to the specialist track .
vince and i feel this is clearly in the best interests of enron given matt ' s
proven strengths in quant analysis .
how do we proceed ?
all the best ,
steve
