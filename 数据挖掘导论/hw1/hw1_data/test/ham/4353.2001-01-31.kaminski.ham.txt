the system will not allow me to view this request , saying that it has been
assigned to you . i have left a message with the admin who originated these
requests . if i don ' t hear back from her today , i think we should just deny
all of them . i earlier sent emails to the individuals named asking what
data they needed to access and none of them responded .
