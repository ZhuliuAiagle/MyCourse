Subject: allocation of capital
i think we urgently ( next 2 days ) need to have a meeting to discuss where we allocate capital and risk . counterparties are very nervous and many are not extending us credit so we are having to prepay extensively to do business , both in the us and uk . i have two suggestions :
- allocate to each business a fraction of our available liquidity
or
- appoint someone to make the call when a large chunk of cash is needed .
for example , egm wants to send out $ 200 - $ 300 million for sixty days to buy physical to cover an option with koch .
we do not have infinite liquidity and we need to address it fast . i will try to set up a meeting tomorrow .
