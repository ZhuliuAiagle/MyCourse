subject : just so you know
john arnold asked me this morning about individuals on eol . apparently , . john was told that i had a problem with this . i haven ' t had a conversation on this since 1999 , . at that time i sidelined the issue as it was complex , bearing in mind everything else that was going on . i would suggest you and mark address tis together .
i have no idea who told john this as i haven ' t had a dizcussion on this issue since 1999 .
