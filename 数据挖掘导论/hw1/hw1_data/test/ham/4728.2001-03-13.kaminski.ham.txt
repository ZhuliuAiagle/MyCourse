Subject: the national forum on corporate finance
hello mr . fastow ,
sheridan titman from ut - austin and i are both delighted you will be able to
participate in the conference we are organizing here at rice . attached is
a revised overview of the organization - the second page contains an
up - to - date list of the firms involved .
also , i ' m attaching a draft of the actual program . after each
presentation , i have a panel of three or four people who will can respond
to some of the points or issues raised in each discussion . these remarks
will be very informal and ad hoc and thus should require no preparation on
your part . reaction to this format has been good and i think it will be a
great way to stimulate discussion / debate .
i have you penciled in to serve on one such panel on saturday morning , may
5 . the topic deals with handing the dilution arising from executive stock
options and involves the top academic expert on executive stock options ,
david yermack from nyu .
let me know if you have any concerns about this or if a conflict
arises . also , i will be e - mailing some registration materials to you in
the next week .
i look forward to seeing you soon .
dave ikenberry .
