dear all ,
attached is the spreadsheet " benzenecurves . xls " ( also available in
s : \ research \ globalproducts ) that will hopefully allow you to derive a
mid - curve for benzene based upon our existing naphtha curve produced by
tracy . the previous hedge ratio analysis is still part of the new
spreadsheet .
for clarity a graph of the curve based on 1996 through 2000 data is depicted
below :
i can also provide confidence bands on the regression model , if this can
assist in deciding the bid - offer spread for the forward curve , but this is
slightly more involved - let me know you ' d like this .
regards ,
