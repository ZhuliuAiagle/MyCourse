ok . i know that !
i wasn ' t planning to " promote " all the managers to director however . just retitle them , leave their salaries as is . if we want to give them all bumps to $ 115 ( from $ 95 ) , then i ' ll start water dropping that .
i was assuming you wanted 2 or 3 new md ' s , 5 or 10 new vp ' s and probably 50 or 60 other incidental changes on the support side between specialists and snr directors ( presuming we don ' t do away with titles for support folks ) .
