dale ,
friday is a bad day ( performance review committee all day ) .
what about 7 : 00 at the office or breakfast meeting at 7 : 00 ? we can meet
at hyatt regency downtown ( smith street ) .

vince :
can we get together friday morning july 7 at 800 am at your office ? that
would be particularly convenient for me . i will have to leave downtown at
about 945 to catch a plane . that will ensure that i wont take up too much
of your time ! ! thanks for your efforts here , and thanks for being patient
with me .
