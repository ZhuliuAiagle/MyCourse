subject : re : is there any chance you could chair a session at the conference ?
dear joel ,
will be glad to help out but had a look at the stream 2 on monday
and it is 1120 am - 520 pm covering three sessions ! ! !
could i suggest that i take the 1120 am - lunch session and you can find another
speaker ( s ) from day 2
to chair the afternoon session ( s ) .
i am flexible if you need me to take a different time on the monday .
