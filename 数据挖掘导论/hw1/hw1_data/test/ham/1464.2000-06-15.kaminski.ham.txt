subject : volumetric optionality model changes
as a result of meetings with zimin lu ( houston research ) and anjam ahmad in
early june , the gas desk together with research will be revising the models
for pricing options on volume ( swing ) and similar products .
the idea is to have a consistent method that can be applied to all contracts .
this will affect :
flat price gas swing options
indexed gas swing options
j - block contract
modified thermbank contract
enbank ( virtual storage )
the new feature that will be introduced into all models is ability for
real - time mtm ( and prospectively - sensitivities calculations ) .
the work will be carried out as follows :
natasha danilochkina : problem definition , contracts / products summary ,
functional specification
anjam ahmad : zimin ' s model modifications / implementation and houston / london
