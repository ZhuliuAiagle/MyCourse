Subject: re : part - time work
vince ,
zimin and i talked briefly about the part - time work this morning . to recap ;
i am willing to work 20 hours a week , however , i expressed my concern about
commuting every week . i asked if commuting once every two weeks ( and work
out of austin every other week ) would be acceptable . as to the term of the
work , i suggested a 3 - mo period ( i have yet not talked to international
office which arranges work authorization using curricular practical training
of which i have used up 9 months already ) , i might run into problems if i
ask for more . i also mentioned that i would do my best to accomodate your
preferences . we did not discuss any other details .
i shall be awaiting for your response on this matter .
best ,
