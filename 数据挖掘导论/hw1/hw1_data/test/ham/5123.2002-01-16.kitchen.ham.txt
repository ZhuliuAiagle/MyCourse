looks like they are pushing back on the " w " .
we are just about ready to start changing site name references . please confirm whether you want us to proceed with the originally discussed ubsenergy or if we should in fact change references to ubswenergy .
thanks ,

hi dave / kal
looks like we can use the ubswenergy . com domain name for a few months
then integrate you guys into the ubswarburg policies over time . can
you send back an email confirming that this works for you . i think
this is the best compromise we can reach for the moment which allows us
to not waste any more time in discussions !
thx
ursula

following our conversation this morning i just want to confirm what we
have agreed .
pat - please can you read through the points below and send stuart an
e - mail confirming that you agree with everything , particularly the
' conditions ' section , and that all the ubs warburg energy staff will
comply with the conditions as laid out below .
decisions :
= = = = = = =
1 ) the brand name for the new trading entity that we are acquiring from
enron will be ubs warburg energy .
2 ) the domain name will be www . ubswenergy . com and we will also point ,
but not market , various other domain names to the site , eg
www . ubsenergy . com , www . ubswarburgenergy . com
3 ) the new entity will follow all ubs warburg corporate identity rules
in terms of font , imagery and colour usage for all printed and online
material .
conditions :
= = = = = = = =
1 ) that in 6 months ' time ( week beginning 29 july 2002 ) our position is
reviewed . if this venture is successful and we plan to continue with
it , the branding position will change and the entity will be fully
incorporated into ubs warburg and any changes necessary with regard to
branding will be made .
2 ) the domain name will change , will follow corporate guidelines and
will follow the format of www . ubswarburg . com / energy ( where the
' / energy ' part can be discussed in order to ensure the most appropriate
name is used .
3 ) all printed material will be changed to reflect the change in brand
which therefore means that any material produced immediately will have
a relatively short shelf - life as it may have to be re - printed .
