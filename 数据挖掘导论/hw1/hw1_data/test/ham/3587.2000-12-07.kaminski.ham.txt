subject : re : developing my electricity model at enron
dr . kaminski :
i am the phd student at the business school at carnegie mellon who is
interested in energy modeling . thanks once again for taking the time
to talk with me about my model for electricity during your recent
visit to carnegie mellon . during our conversation , you had mentioned
the possibility of my coming out to enron to work on developing my
model , possibly through an internship . is this still an option ? if so ,
could you please advise me how to proceed .
sincerely ,
aziz a . lookman
