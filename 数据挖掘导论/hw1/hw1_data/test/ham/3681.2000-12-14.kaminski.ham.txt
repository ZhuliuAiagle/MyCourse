subject : working with enron on catastrophic risk
dear vince , jim , george , david and vasant :
neil doherty , paul kleindorfer and i very much enjoyed our discussion last
wednesday at wharton with you on future joint research with enron over the
coming year . in particular , we see the whole area of capital management and
catastrophic risk as a fruitful area for foint collaboration . i am sharing
this message with louis thomas and keith weigelt who direct the fap mba
program in the hopes that we can find a team to work with us on these issues
next semester .
attached is a revised version of our paper on " evaluating risk bearing ,
mitigation and risk transfer using exceedance probability curves : project
update " . we would greatly appreciate you and your colleagues looking at the
section on " cat bonds covering multiple risks " ( pp . 15 - 19 ) to see whether our
example and conclusions make sense to you . we look forward to working with
your team at enron regarding ways that we can build on these preliminary
findings to make cat bonds for weather risks more attractive .
best wishes for the holiday .
regards ,
howard
