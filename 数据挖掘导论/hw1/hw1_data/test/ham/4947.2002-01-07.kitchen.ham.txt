Subject: restart plan and employee briefing documents - drafts
louise
david has asked me to prepare the following
1 ) restart plan - as per your request
.
2 ) employee briefing - pre deal execution communication - knowing as much as we know now and speculating to a certain extent on how some of the benefits / terms etc will be treated . this needs work on the business overview and business outlook but i see this as a " pre offer " sales pitch to employees to be followed up with another one the purchaser is known and then with the actual offer itself
both are drafts
