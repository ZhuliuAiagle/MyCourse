Subject: re : commoditylogic launch checklist
after reviewing calenders , etc . , i recommend the following :
launch on august 6 th ( assuming the launch checklist is complete and we have all signoffs ) . next week is final prc for me , whalley etc . early in the week and i am out thursday and friday next week . therefore we can show the entire checklist and functionality to whalley the following week , hopefully around august lst or so , and then you can roll from test into production on that weekend and go out monday the 6 th .

greg :
sending this update in lieu of today ' s 11 : 00 meeting . in summary , all departments are working with a finalized
checklist , which is attached . of the 8 functional areas involved here , only one has a potential issue that would
delay a launch past the july 23 rd scheduled date . this is confirmlogic . some minor " bugs " were identified by
users . the confirm it group has made modifications and will retest today or tomorrow . if the testing does not
go well , there could be a production delay .
other noteworthy item is from pr . they have decided to delay any press release until the market conditions
are appropriate .
as i have been given responsibility for completion of this list , please feel free to contact me regarding any
issues or comments . if i am unavailable , you might try doug feuhne at 5 - 3992 .
