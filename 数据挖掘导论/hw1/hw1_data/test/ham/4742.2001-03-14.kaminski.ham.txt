dear ms . patrick ,
?
anne stamer asked me to contact you regarding ? enron providing a judge for
phase iii of the business plan competition . ? phase iii judges are generally
partner - level individuals at venture capital firms , ? managing directors from
investment banks , or other senior individuals ? who have extensive experience
assessing and working with early stage ventures . ? a phase iii judge will
receive five business plans , with the entire judging process requiring 4 - 5
hours during the weeks of april 2 and april 9 . ? i am attaching a document
that describes the competition and judging procedures for phase iii in more
detail . ? we are looking to finalize the list of phase iii judges by march
23 , so if you could please forward either anne or i the name of the
appropriate individual , we can contact them directly with more details . ?
please let me know if you have further questions and we appreciate your
support of the competition .
?
sincerely ,
?
