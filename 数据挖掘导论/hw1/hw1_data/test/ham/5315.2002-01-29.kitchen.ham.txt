Subject: names , homepage and such
louise ,
- ubs do not want us to show " ubswenergy . com " - they require " www . ubswenergy . com " ( no caps ) or " ubswenergy . com " ( no " www " ) .
- this means that for the homepage to look right , we will change the name to " ubs warburg energy " beside the globe graphic .
- currently anticipate starting top 50 marketing for pa ' s by tomorrow morning ( ubs required changes on splash page ) .
- some traders in the market have started to refer to us as ub sol . although the low - profile approach we discussed made sense , on further reflection , i think we need to aggressively promote a positive short name for the system , to avoid the " sol " connotation . even " ubs energy " is a lot of syllables . we are working on finding some alternative ( perhaps which don ' t use " ubs " in the name , as that seems to be a sensitive point ) . if we are to do this , we will need to lobby at a level higher than where i have been so far . if you agree with my concern , some higher level contact might be in order ; perhaps with some of the people you have been meeting ?
- will work with legal today on master agreements and gtc ' s , to try to get template approval and to draft masters for the top 50 , with specific credit terms .
