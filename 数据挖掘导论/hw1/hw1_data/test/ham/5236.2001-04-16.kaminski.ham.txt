subject : weather and energy price data
dear dr . kaminski :
i am a phd candidate under the supervision of drs . richard macminn and
patrick brockett . i am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
the weather derivatives and credit derivatives .
could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions ?
the past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide , and there may be a
significant price jump for natural gas or electricity . could you
please offer me some energy price data during that time period ?
your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day !
mulong
