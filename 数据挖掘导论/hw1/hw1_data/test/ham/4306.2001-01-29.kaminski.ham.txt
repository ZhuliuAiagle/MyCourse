fyi . this could be quite important for us . through forming a tradinf co . we
could be brokering deals on behalf of mseb , without letting them off the hook .
in this manner we could be doing short term deals and increasing despatch
from dabhol or other mseb marginal units . any money flowing from these sales
should go into an escrow account that goes directly towards payment of dpc
bills .
in this manner we would be increasing the payment ability of mseb .

sandeep .

wade : the group of ministers on foreign investment had decided to recommend
foreign equity participation upto 100 % for trading in power sector , subject
to prevailing laws . however , they left the final decision to the union
cabinet . it is understood that a note supporting the recommendation of gom is
being put up for consideration of union cabinet . since power minister is
willing to support the proposal and industry minister is already ok with such
proposals , i don ' t anticipate any problem at the cabinet level . let us wait
and watch the developments .
