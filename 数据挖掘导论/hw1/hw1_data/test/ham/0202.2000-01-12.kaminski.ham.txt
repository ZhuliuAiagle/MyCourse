i have attached a rough draft of the agenda with the topics being
considered
for the conference . it is being held in washington , dc on june
19 - 20 , 2000 .
if your schedule allows , please join our speaking faculty . you will
notice
that the topic on " forecasting and measuring your exposures to
energy price
risk " is not currently on the agenda . we can add it once you have a
chance
to check your schedule . i also ask that you make recommendations of
any
colleagues or industry professionals who can add expertise to the
conference
as well .
if you have any questions or concerns , please do not hesitate to
contact me
at 212 - 661 - 3500 x 3181 . i look forward to hearing from you . thank
you once
again for your time and assistance .
