anjam ,
this would be a good opportunity to update the content on the intranet site
and expand the coverage into new areas . can you arrange some it resources
for us ? if everyone in research works on developing the content , we just
need it to publish it out to the intranet .
thoughts ? ?

hi sven ,
thanks a lot for your note - i think it would be great to see what we can do
to help you & joe ' s business units . plenty of our knowledge is no longer
proprietary in that quite a lot of this information is now in the public
domain - we can sit down and discuss this on thursday afternoon if that works
for you .
regards ,
anjam

anjam , congratulations on your initiative . i appreciate that you share this
information throughout enron .
as you may know , my group is working with joe ' s business units to create
so - called market hubs .
i see great potential in sharing some of the information that you have
acucmulated and that is not proprietary to enron .
i would appreciate if we could sit down tomorrow and talk about the
possibility to leverage on the existing know - how .
regards
sven
