washington - ( dow jones ) - ubs warburg ' s bid to take over the energy trading business of enron corp . ( ene ) will require federal energy regulatory commission approval , ferc chairman pat wood iii confirmed wednesday .
once cleared by the bankruptcy court , ferc expects to receive an application for approval of the deal under the commission ' s authority , wood told reporters .
ferc ' s jurisdiction involves the transfer of enron ' s commission - granted authority to regulate the rates at which enron sells electricity and natural gas , said cynthia marlette , ferc ' s general counsel .
but marlette indicated the commission is mulling whether to exert a broader regulatory reach over the deal . " the commission hasn ' t opined yet whether it has jurisdiction over the corporate transfer , " she said .
as announced in recent days , ubs warburg , a unit of ubs ag ( u . ubs ) , will assume enron ' s trading business with little if any cash up front , while paying enron royalties equal to 33 % of pre - tax earnings .
the bankruptcy judge is due to rule on the deal later this week .
