dear dr . kaminski ,
how are you ? it was nice to meet you at the real options conference
in
nyc .
i was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk . in
particular , by your use of real options to hedge financial options . this
is
something i am interested in as well .
when you have some time , could we chat about this topic in a bit more
detail ?
thanks for your time and consideration . hope to hear from you soon .
regards ,
iris mack
