lousie ,
my group gathers the gas and power physical volumes that are used in quarterly press releases , sec filings and other communications . investor relations typically likes to look at this information on a monthly basis to make sure that they understand the direction that volumes are going . the attached file details gas and power volumes by region for the most recent periods . the gas volumes from july to august of this year show a slight downward trend that i wanted to make sure that you were aware of . we pull this information from the unify settlement system and have rarely had problems with the accuracy of that data . none the less , we typically run it by desk heads when the numbers don ' t seem to fit our expectations . after a brief review by the central and east guys they told us that lower price volatility and the ice trading platform were the significant reasons for the decline . is this in line with your expectations ? power volumes on the other hand are up considerably in august . we have not received a response on that yet .
please call me if you would like to discuss .
