antelope is a project that we acquired last year from aes . the project has land , some early permits , and a transmission queue position that we used at pastoria . total consideration paid to aes was approximately $ 15 mm , most of which was charged to pastoria . the resulting cost basis should be about $ 1 . 8 mm plus the erc ' s not used at pastoria ( approx . $ 6 mm ) . over the next 4 months we will determine whether we want to pursue the project or , if not , write off the $ 1 . 8 mm and sell / transfer the erc ' s for a gain of $ 1 . 8 mm + .
coyote springs was a project that we developed and sold in 2000 . it was a 280 mw 7 fa that we co - developed with portland general and sold pre - construction to avista for a $ 18 mm promote . there should not be any balance sheet exposure associated with it - we are done .
