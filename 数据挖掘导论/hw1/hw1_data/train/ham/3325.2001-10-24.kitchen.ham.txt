i spoke with gregg in chicago . the transactions that i mentioned to you that were already in the works include 1 ) $ 40 mm storage inventory from prime rate to current curve 2 ) pre - pay for $ 75 to $ 100 mm for ena transaction with peoples gas ( meeting next week ) 3 ) enovate has $ 20 mm with citibank ( 50 % enron / 50 % peoples ) that we have been trying to get to enron treasury since march of this year .
if i get the word from you , we potentially could wrap all three of these to front cash to enron . i would need to directly make this request to tom and bill or we might send a scary signal to them and require significant enron corporate guarantees .
let me know . . .
