ceo says texas in good shape for electricity deregulation
dallas ( ap ) - enron corp . ' s chief executive and president said tuesday he
believes that texas energy markets are in good shape as the state prepares
for deregulation .
jeffrey skilling told an audience of about 400 business people at a downtown
hotel that california " has given the term deregulation a terrible name . "
electric deregulation in texas officially starts jan . 1 . " in texas , i think
we ' ve got a pretty good system , " he said .
in san francisco on tuesday , the california public utilities commission
unanimously approved electricity rate increases of up to 46 percent to try to
head off blackouts this summer by keeping the state ' s two biggest utilities
from going under . when california officials set up deregulation they allowed
the price of wholesale electricity to rise but capped the amount companies
could charge customers , skilling said . socal edison and pacific gas &
electric say they have lost more than $ 13 billion since last summer because
they haven ' t been able to pass on the high cost of wholesale electricity .
skilling said texans are in a much better position and shouldn ' t worry that
their state ' s deregulation would be like the california experience .
" california , they just put together a crazy system ,  8 he said in his first
public comments since becoming the houston - based company ' s chief executive
officer in february . " the markets in california are the most regulated
markets in north america today . and that ' s what is causing the problem . "

the setting of rules in the regulation for how power transmission tariffs can

allocation at borders within the eu should be managed by transmission system
operators .
enron concludes that it is encouraged by the efforts of the commission to
accelerate the european electricity and gas market opening and the
reinforcement of third party rights of access to transmission networks . the
commission ' s approach of harmonizing both the timetable and the regulatory
framework deserves support from all member states .
