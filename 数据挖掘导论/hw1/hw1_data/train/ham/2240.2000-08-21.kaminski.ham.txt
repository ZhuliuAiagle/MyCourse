Subject: sas online tutorial
hi -
we have access to the sas online tutorial for the next 30 days . point your
browser to
and use the username " enron " and password " enron " to enter .
the way this product works is designed for a single user ( it sets a " cookie "
allowing you to " resume " your place in the tutorial when you re - enter . )
since several of us may use it , we ' ll need to work around this , each of us
remembering where we were before and recreating any sample data sets , etc
necessary for the lesson in progress .

ps the module eis / olap will be a part of our installation next month , but is
not currently available
pps please remember to use your local browser to browse the sas online
documentation . invoking a browser on the unix server is inefficient .
