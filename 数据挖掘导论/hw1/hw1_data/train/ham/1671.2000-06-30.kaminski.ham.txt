vince ,
ravi never said a word to me and should have closely coordinated with me -
otherwise he should have used his own name . i have a problem with ravi
acting in that manner . no one is questioning shalesh ' integrity but the
associate analyst program called me and stated that shalesh told them that i
had requested the move . if he did that he should not have used my name . i
am very sensitive to analysts moving within a rotation . it has happened to
me numerous times and i do not appreciate the disruption it can cause . if
you need shalesh for any reason then he will not be moving .
regards
jim

jim ,
clarification regarding shalesh ' transfer to ebs .
the request to rotate shalesh out of research into ebs
came from ravi thuraisingham . my understanding was that it was
fully coordinated with you and i was more than happy to oblige .
shalesh is concerned that his integrity is being questioned and i can assure
you that he was not the instigator of the move .
my impression is that shalesh is doing a very good job and ravi is very happy
him . i shall be glad to keep him in the research group in his current role .
have a good 4 th of july .
