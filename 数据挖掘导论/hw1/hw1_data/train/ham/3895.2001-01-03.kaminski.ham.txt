Subject: meeting with petronas
rick ,
i was contacted by petronas who requested a meeting
with enron on risk management . i have met with them
a few years ago and they want to discuss with us
their progress implementing risk management practices .
can we arrange for them a standard presentation , like the one we have for
banks
( you or david port , bill bradford , research ) ?
unfortunately , they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
( given a very tight schedule ) . they want to visit on thursday , feb . 8 ,
at 10 a . m . i shall take them out to lunch after the meeting .
i shall also contact jeff shankman and john nowlan
to arrange a short courtesy meeting with them .
