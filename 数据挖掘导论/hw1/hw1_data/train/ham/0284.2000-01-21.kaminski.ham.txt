Subject: projected fund giving
george -
here is one statistical method ( linear regression ) , applied to hosanna ' s fund
giving . the method is deterministic , where contributions each sunday are
attempted to be explained by significant events on the church ' s and members '
calendars , and the method shoudl be considered in contrast to an anecdotal
one , where each sunday ' s giving might be estimated to be the average giving
of the same sunday ( e . g . , each 2 nd sunday in january ) in the past .
the following effects are estimated independently by the computer ( they add
and subtract with each other accordingly ; some sundays can have more than one
effect " in play " ) :
1 ) most positive for giving : an additional + $ 8 , 802 for special pastoral
appeals ( 3 of them in the past 3 years )
2 ) positive for giving : an additional + $ 2 , 551 easter and nearest - christmas
" sunday , " an additional + $ 59 thanksgiving sunday , and a tiny additional + $ 1
each week pure time trend .
3 ) negative for giving : - $ 304 for sundays of monday federal holiday weekends ,
and - $ 9 during the summer ( june 1 - aug 31 )
4 ) " wave " : there is an $ 80 per week " wave " - giving $ 80 higher one week , $ 80
lower the next , etc . . .
the computer can explain roughly 60 % of the absolute variation in giving the
past 3 years using this approach . keep in mind , much of the information ,
statistically , is captured in the pastoral appeals , easter and christmas
sundays , and holiday weekends . the rest of the variation cannot be explained
by this simple model ( i . e . , it looks like " noise " ) .
here are the predictions for fund giving for the upcoming year . you can
cut - and - paste these numbers to any file or spreadsheet you like . they may
seem " boring " to you ; please remember they are the deterministic components
of a process that involves a lot of volatility , and your church ' s actual
experience will predictably be volatile . these numbers are as - if the " means "
of experiences dependent on the " standard deviations . "
