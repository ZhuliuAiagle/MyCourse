good morning ,

also note that on september 10 and 11 , csfb will host a power generation
supply chain conference at the plaza hotel in new york city . this event is
designed to provide investors with a wholistic perspective on all aspects of
the sector - from coal and natural gas companies , to equipment and
construction service providers , to the power producers themselves . please
contact us if you would like additional information .
1 . ipps rise 0 . 4 % last week our ipp composite rose 0 . 4 % , slightly
underperforming both the nasdaq ( + 1 . 8 % ) and the s 2 . the article ' s thesis does not
consider the potential for retirement of existing capacity , and 3 . the
regional characteristics of the power generation market resist such broad
sweeping generalizations .
3 . credit spreads continue to improve importantly , while our ipp equity
composite has traded off more than 10 % over the last few weeks , ipp credit
spreads continue to tighten . for example , while calpine shares have traded
off 11 % since july 6 , the spreads on cpn ' s 10 year 8 . 5 % notes due 2011 have
actually tightened by more than 50 basis points . last week alone , cpn
spreads tightened by 12 basis points , while the stock traded off 3 % . to
cite another example , while mirant shares have traded off 8 % over the same
period , the spreads on mir ' s 7 . 9 % notes due 2009 have tightened by 55 basis
points .
4 . q 2 earnings review last week second quarter earnings results were
reported by black hills , cleco , dpl , entergy , mirant and orion power .
upside surprises were reported by dpl , etr , mir and orn . versus
expectations , mirant ' s results were the strongest , coming in 21 % above our
estimate . cleco was the only company that posted an earnings
disappointment , reporting q 2 results that were 22 % below our estimate .
5 . power market update last week power prices were up considerably as
evidenced by the 27 % increase in the mirant national power index . with the
exception of the western market , power prices got a boost from hot
temperatures that blanketed most of the country . the texas market
experienced unusual volatility owing to recent wholesale market design
changes and the initiation of a retail competition pilot program .
