dale ,
thanks for your message .
i don ' t know the labor market in london that well but here the market
for quants is very hot . steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and i would go an extra mile to retain him long - term for the company .
i would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit .
o 62 , 000 basic is what anjam is receiving currently ( if i remember
correctly ) . steve has a much higher value
to enron than anjam .
