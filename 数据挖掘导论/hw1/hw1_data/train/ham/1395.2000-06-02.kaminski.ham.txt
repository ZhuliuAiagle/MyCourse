hi vince ,
?
just a friendly reminder that the hired guns are making their way up to
houston to visit with you and grant .
?
i was reading the promotional material for the eprm conference here in july .
i wanted to invite you to dinner at my apartment on the evening between the
main conference and the post - conference seminars ( 18 th july ) . we have a
pretty spectacular view of the harbour here that you might enjoy .
?
best regards .
?
chris .
