Subject: e & p model
vince - attached is the most recent e & p version of the old corporate cash
flow model that i could find . note that " most recent " still dates it back a
few years . a couple caveats : i did try to clean it up somewhat from old
macros , but no guarntees offered . also , some of the underlying methodology
is not what we would probably currently use , such as for pricing , stochastic
processes , and perhaps decline rates .
please let me know if i can provide any additional help .
