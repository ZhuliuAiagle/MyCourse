subject : our workshop
dear vince ,
our workshop has already 20 registered delegates ,
which is very good given the french power situation .
moreover , french people tend to be fairly educated
and we should coordinate a little bit .
i am leaving in 30 minutes for 2 days . can we talk on sunday
at 7 or 8 p . m my time ? my 2 numbers will be
33 1 46040110 or 33 6 08074200
alex would agree to speak for a while as we did in francfort .
karla sent me a proposal for the escrow problem . i had a
further question in your direction regarding " system support " .
karla , as you know , would kindly like to wrap up the contract
before moving to a new department and i will do my very
best to satisfy her wish and your feasible requests .
kind regards
helyette
