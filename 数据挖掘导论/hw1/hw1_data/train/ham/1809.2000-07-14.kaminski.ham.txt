hi shane ,
thanks for your e - mail . we actually sent the 9 of the 11 chapters off to the
typesetter today and i will forward you our word documents in the morning .
i ' ve been travelling a lot to the uk at the moment and so haven ' t spent much
time with the student myself . are you going to te energy confernece next
week , perhaps we can meet up there ?
good to hear about the weather . we are actually going to run a two day
course thru uts on weather derivatives the first weekend of september . feel
free to tell your potential clients about it if you think it will bring up
the industry knowledge . maybe we can associate your name with the course
somehow which might help both of us ?
