due to the needs of the ees business , louis has agreed to change his role and get involved in structuring retail deals . unfortunately , that means that he will have to relocate to 14 until we get to the new building . his combination of ena wholesale experience and his prior pg & e retail experience make him a very valuable asset for that effort . louis will retain responsibility for the mgu transaction until a logical hand - off point , which may be as late as the date mgu is closed and booked .
kelli little will assume the role of leading ena ( wholesale ) central region gas structuring . kelli ' s has certainly earned this opportunity and i am confident that she will add value to the central region ' s effort .
please join me in congratulating louis and kelli in their new roles .
