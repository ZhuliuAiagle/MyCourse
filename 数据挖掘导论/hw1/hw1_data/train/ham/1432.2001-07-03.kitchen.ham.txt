Subject: contract numbers
i am making good progress . i have met with mike , matt , bob , and jeff . it sounds like mike is done , the rest are close . i told each of them that this is a " fill or kill " bid . if they like it then we ' ll get done , if not then we can revisit at the end of their existing contracts . i also told each of them that if the market changes between now and then that it ' s their risk . i also said that if they value keeping their options open that they better figure out some way to monetize their theta as enron would not be in a position to make them whole for what they would have been paid had they chosen not to keep their options open .
i still have a couple of issues . one is greg wolfe . i am thinking that his package should look quite similar to motley ' s . i need to show him numbers today and would like to talk with one or both of you about it before i talk to greg . i want to show him numbers for a two - year and a three - year contract . he is currently talking to aep , calpine , and arizona public service . he is asking for a lot of money to stay : base of 200 , signing of 100 , annual retention of 100 plus equity of 600 with a two year vest . he would also do a 3 year deal with equity of 800 with a three year vest . i have talked a little bit with mike s . about how important wolfe is to the northwest middle market effort . the answer was that he is really important because he knows all of the customers , he knows enron ' s internal process , and he is very good at working with mike to get deals executed and papered properly . having said that , mike said that he supports whatever decision i come up with in terms of retaining wolfe - - in other words , if he leaves then he leaves and mike is ok with that .
i ' d like to talk to one of you this afternoon to hear your thoughts and ideas on this . i ' ll give you a call .
