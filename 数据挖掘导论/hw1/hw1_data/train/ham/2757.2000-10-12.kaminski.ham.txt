i am writing a management report on weather risk management . the story
will discuss different weather risk management tools used by power
marketers in the energy industry . it also looks at weather prediction
and analysis services available to energy traders .
i am looking for a list and description of the weather risk management
products , and how each can benefit an energy trader . i would also like
to know what traders ' reactions to significant weather are . and where
can i find a list of popular weather instruments with descriptions ?
i appreciate any help you can give me . i would like to set up a chat
with you this week if you have the time , or simply email me your input .
