margaret ,
thanks for reminding me this issue . i think i ' ll be fine until i start full time here in the research group . as you know right now i am using curricular practical training as work permission . and until i graduate i am allowed do as many as part time cpt i want to do . because of tax purposes i think i ' ll use this right given to me . in this case , what i need to do is that after i and vince make sure about my full time start date ( this may happen in the beginning of 2002 ) , i ' ll let you know and send you the necessary document you require to initiate my hlb visa application process . thanks again .

sevil : in order that we may proceed with your request for permanent residency , our immigration attorneys have advised us that we need to process the hib visa , prior to the permanent residency application .
therefore , i am attaching an hib visa questionnaire that i would like you to complete and return to me , together with copies of all of the documents listed at the bottom of the form .
please bring these to me in 3 ac 2026 a .
please let me know if you have any questions at x 55083 .
