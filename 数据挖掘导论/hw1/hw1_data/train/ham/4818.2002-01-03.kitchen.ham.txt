Subject: issues and update
louise ,
three questions / issues which i ' d appreciate your feedback on :
1 ) i am planning to arrange for a meeting with gas and power originators / traders tomorrow to let them know what we are planning with the top 50 customers ( sending draft pa ' s ) and enlist their support for calls where we can leverage their relationships with the customers .
2 ) after some more thought , i ' m on the fence about sending out the pa ' s without names . the following occurs to me :
- sending them out on tuesday is only three days before we know what the final name will be
- sending them out with the final name probably helps our credibility
- the pa / eta is a very simple form ; customers probably don ' t require the extra three days to review them .
- following the public release of our new buyers ' identity with the first release of the pa helps build a bit more excitement than otherwise .
3 ) i understand you are objecting to the provision which would allow us to release a customers ' name to another company . i don ' t think most customers would object to this and getting the provisions in up front gives us more flexibility later . can we keep this in ?
thanks ,
dave
