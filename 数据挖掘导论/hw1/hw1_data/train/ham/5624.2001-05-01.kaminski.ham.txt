vince ,
he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background ( and then some
credit exposure calculation ) with not much credit data analysis experience .
i do not think he would be appropriate for bryan ' s group - - he needs a person
who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data , and although
this guy may be good at modeling , we already have iris and amitava doing the
modeling and looking at data . at this stage , i would prefer to hire somebody
with direct experience in credit analysis ( banking , rating agency ) . i am
worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience , then
amitava will find himself with two people ( iris being the other one ) who are
both inexperienced in this area , and he will find himself doing a lot of the
work anyway .
if you want to pursue him , we should probably do a phone interview first .
