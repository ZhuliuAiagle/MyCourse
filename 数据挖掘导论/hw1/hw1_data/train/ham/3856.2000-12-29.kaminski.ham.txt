vince , sorry , the files from that directory get deleted periodically . i
attached this file here .
rabi did some analysis related to implementation of correlated non - normally
( rtdm - distributed )
variables . let ' s discuss later ?

everybody ,
we were talking for a while about using non - normal distributions in the
monte - carlo simulations in our var model .
i put together some suggestion regarding this . the text is under
o : \ _ dropbox \ tanya \ non _ normal _ logs . doc
look through this 3 page document , and let me know what you think , please .
