Subject: re : storage book . . .
hi stinson , shales ' initial in road to ebs was through david cox ( after
vince ' s suggest to talk to david , i think ) . what shalesh did at the time was
to put a four page concept on trading storage as a commodity in the new
networked world . he has keen interest in such an idea and has done some
work . he will be a good fit unless that person has to be in ebs under jean
etc . . . . if so , we are not ready to let shalesh go ! he can support that
effort , but i need him to get the supply & demand work in real - time user
friendly form for jean ' s traders before shalesh ventures onto something
else . i did promising that i will get him involved in some juicy stuff like
new product / deals etc . . . . this may be his non - it stuff that he can do . . . . .
what do you think ?

ravi :
samer and i met this morning with sara ledbetter . she is starting the
groundwork for setting up a storage book and a streaming book for tracking
the e - powered products positions . they are having a meeting on next
tuesday to discuss this . samer will attend . this is a good opportunity to
start compiling the data that we will need for some of john grieblings
questions .

p . s . sara also asked if we knew anyone who would be interested in managing
the storage book . any suggestions ?
