the sun may be setting on californians ' right to customer choice as the cpuc debates the fate of direct access today . we estimate that at this time , the cpuc commissioners will not be taking up the da issue and will instead delay the vote until after the legislature has convened the third special session , called by gov . davis last week . currently , both commissioners brown and wood appear unwilling to support da ; with president lynch being a swing vote .
concerning the retroactive suspension of direct access agreements of customers who have already elected alternate service providers , the current cpuc position appears to be that direct access contracts signed by september 20 th , 2001 will not be nullified . there is rumor that the cpuc may be reviewing several of the contracts signed within the past three to nine months . many commercial consumers now operating under da are highly pessimistic about the cpuc supporting da agreements that have been signed within the past three months . the business community is very conscience that the cpuc now bears the difficult task of weighing california businesses ' political and economic interests against the economic interests of california ' s residential power consumers .
