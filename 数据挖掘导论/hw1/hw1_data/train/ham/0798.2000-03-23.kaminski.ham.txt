hello !
the 29 th will be fine - - if we can definitely get everything in by then . i
just worry a little when we start getting less than a month out . we need to
make sure that our conference services office has enough time to detail all
of your functions properly so that everything flows smoothly .
also please know that the availability of those $ 274 airfares is also not
guaranteed until booked ( you know how those airlines are about changing fares
around ) . we need to be able to book a specific class of service to get that
fare , so once those are gone the fare cannot be guaranteed . do you want me
to get started with the air contract ?
please keep me posted ! thanks !

good morning steve :
i received your voice mail and the flight information sounds great !
i need to update you as to the status of everything at present .
the contract is fine , however , i am not authorized to sign it , so if it is
allright , we are putting " john griebling ' s " name in my place . he will
sign
the contract and we will put the charges on his credit card .
however , john is out of town and will not be back in until tomorrow . this
may cut it a little close as to getting everything back to you by monday ,
the 27 th . is there a possibility of getting this deadline pushed back a
couple of days ? we are also having a problem getting a commitment from
the
top management people - they are all out of town at present . this does not
involve very many - only 3 or 4 people , but we need to get a definate
count
so that we won ' t be short on rooms . if everyone can come , it looks like
we
might need at least 39 rooms .
we should be able to have everthything to you by the 29 th - is this a
problem ?
please let me know as soon as possible .
thanks and have a great day !
