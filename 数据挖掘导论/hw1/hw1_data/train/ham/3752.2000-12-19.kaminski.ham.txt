selectable monte carlo & / or latin hypercube modeling , enough
portfolio analysis power to please the toughest critic , & inputs and
outputs from standard excel & access tables and you ' ve got one of most
powerful tools in the market .

capabilities , added our quarterly database update , increased the speed
of the entire model , and made
but that wasn ' t enough .

included . . .
two new reporting enhancements .

for fuels , resources and groups of resources .

display resource stack information in graphical and dispatch order form .
other enhancements include dual fuel modeling , improved
transmission modeling , greater access to hourly results , and the ability
to model monthly emission rates . moreover , the databases for
central and eastern , texas , and western markets have been updated to use
the new modeling capabilities .

user control over modeling , editing inputs , and viewing of aurora
output . clients desiring to exploit the power of aurora now have
greater control over the inputs and outputs through vb scripting in
