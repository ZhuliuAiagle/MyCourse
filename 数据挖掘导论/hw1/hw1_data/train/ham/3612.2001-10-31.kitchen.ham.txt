we have a potential deal with allegheny for them to post a coal product on enrononline . the total value is thin but the desk is supportive and dan diamond has been charging ahead . in light of enron ' s position currently , do we gain or lose media points by announcing in the near future that eol is allowing third parties to post on their site ? if you are against this , we need to crawfish our way out of the deal with allegheny and put an all - stop on the 1 or 2 others we ' ve been pursuing . if you think it can be spun in a good way for enron , give me your thoughts and we ' ll close the deal .
i know you ' re underwater right now , but i don ' t want to close this deal on the assumption that you ' re ok and find out later you weren ' t .
