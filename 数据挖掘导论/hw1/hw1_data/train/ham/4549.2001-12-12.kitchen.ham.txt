dave ,
i first want to thank you for extending to me the opportunity to come back to enron and with you . dave , your offer is very tempting , however , i have decide that it would be best that i search elsewhere for new employment .
if i may ask you , i would very much appreciate if i can give your name as a professional reference during my job search and if you can write me a letter of reference to help me along with my search . if so , i will be ever so grateful . once , again thank you .
i wish you and avril warm and happy holidays .
sincerely ,
lydia cannon
