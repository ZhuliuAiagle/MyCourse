hi again ,
i had lunch today with some of the guys in my group who work on
agriculture - related deals and on weather derivatives .
i mentioned to them about bernard ' s working at mckinsey and
specializing in the agriculture area .
we thought it might be worthwhile if we all had a chat and / or met
to discuss possible collaborative efforts .
will you please forward this email on to bernard to see if this
might be of interest to him ?
thanks ,
iris
