subject : possible hire ?
dear vince ,
a faculty member in our department , namely dr . keith baggerly ,
is interested in pursuing other employment . he is currently an
assistant professor in our program and a highly valued member of
our department . we hate to lose him , however his interest has shifted
from the academic arena to one of high level but practical application
and development of statistical methodologies including
stochastic modeling .
keith is actually a graduate of our ph . d . program ; he was in the same
group of students as martin lawera . keith spent several years at los
alamos national lab before we recruited him back to rice . he has
been on our faculty now for three years and it is my expectation
( and that of my colleagues ) that if he remained he would receive
tenure .
keith has a strong interest in financial models and the background
to support his interest . he is also a leading expert in statistical
computing , empirical likelihood , categorical models and areas
of statistics falling under the general bailiwick of " data mining " .
he is a creative thinker .
i do not know if there are possibilities for keith within your group ,
however
i believe it is an excellent match of talent and objectives . would you
have an interest in speaking with keith ? if so , i will suggest that he
contact you .
best regards ,
kathy ensor
