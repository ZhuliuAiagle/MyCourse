subject : margin collar
i wanted to give you the status on the bp margin collar deal . we submitted a
bid to bp yesterday where bp would pay enron just under $ 5 mm to assume the
contract . we have yet to have further discussions , so there ' s not much more
to report than that . we greatly appreciate your help on this project . i
feel like we put together a very good bid , and measured the risks
appropriately with limited time . i will keep you informed of how the
negotiations proceed .
thanks again ,
lee jackson
