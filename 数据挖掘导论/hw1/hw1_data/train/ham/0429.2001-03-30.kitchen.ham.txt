subject : nui deal documentation
ed and mark ,
as we discussed , i spoke to jeff hodge and travis mccullough about the best way to document this deal . we all agreed that it is better to document the deal as a deferred payment on the sale of natural gas rather than as a loan . documenting the deal as a loan does not add any protection for enron and in fact , may be detrimental because of the various laws concerning loans and lenders . the protections and remedies afforded by the master track those that enron would have under a loan document . enron would be in no better position to collect from nui in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document than under the master firm purchase / sale agreement . additionally , i assume that nui , being a regulated utility , will not want to or be able to document this deal as a loan .
please let me know if you need additional information on this topic .
