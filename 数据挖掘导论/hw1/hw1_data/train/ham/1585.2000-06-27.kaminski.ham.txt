jana ,
a correction . i am going to spend one week in australia and i have
just realized that i have to leave on friday , july the 14 th , at night ,
to arrive in sydney on sunday morning .
maybe we can meet on friday the 7 th ( we would like to invite you
to dinner and then we can have a glass of wine outside , the weather
and mosquitoes permitting ) .
alternatively , we can meet during the weekend of july the 29 th .
