subject : budget and a & a allocations
so here ' s my question . is there any possibility that we will be not doing the standard bonusses ( which have caused huge problems in the us in the last years ) at the end of this or next year .
i need to know whether to budget the bonus numbers / aa allocations for 2002 .
if you haven ' t thought of this please do as i really do not think its appropriate to go with the nightmare from last year .
