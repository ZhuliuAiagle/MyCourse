Subject: fw : results of ql soft targets
louise :
tim belden forwarded to me the files shown below for " soft targets for ql . " it appears these reports are to track middle market transactions company wide . however , the data does not match our records . attached is a recent report indicating portland middle market year to date earnings of about $ 27 million and 163 transactions . we also have the services desk here in portland run by greg wolfe that is up an additional $ 3 million or so year to date . can you give me the name of an individual who is involved with the reports below so i can contact them and figure out why our numbers differ from those in the reports below ?
thanks !
chris
