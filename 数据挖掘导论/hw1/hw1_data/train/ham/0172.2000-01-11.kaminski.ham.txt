vince ,
thanks for the note - and congratulations on yours as well .
i haven ' t had too much to do yet with the research guys here as they ' re
pretty much self directed . once a week ( thursday am ) i ' ve started a joint
project update meeting with structuring and research . i hope this way the
structuring team can bounce quantitative issues off research and the research
guys can stay closer to the commercial deals .
