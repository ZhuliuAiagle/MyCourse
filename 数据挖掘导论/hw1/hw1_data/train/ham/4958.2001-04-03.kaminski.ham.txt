Subject: re : airfaire for tony
kevin / karin :
my understanding from vince is that london is reponsible for the expenses
incurred while their people are here for training , as well as for any of our
people that go to london at their request .
it should be easy for them to expense this airfare for steve from their office
and charge it to whatever cost center tony is going to be under in london .
