Subject: turbine puts broker / agency - eol
louise ,
a third party developer wants to pay us a small fee ( $ 75 k - $ 100 k ) for the right to use eol . they own lm 6000 ' s and want to buy puts . understandably we offered them a very high premium and a very low strike so they instead want to pay us for the distribtion channel . even though they may be competing with our turbine position , i think we should do it subject to legal . steve thome is talking with brad richter about it .
please let me know if you disagree .
regards ,
