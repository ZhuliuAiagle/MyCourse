fyi .
i ' ve asked for more accurate analysis of what differences are and may need your help to get an agreement to either increase bases for those say below $ 100 k base or give everyone an " allowance " as part of the initial first 12 month transition .

we have this issue in every deal we do , the benefit coverage is good
overall , but employees pay more for the coverage . it ' s income based which
mitigates impact to lower paid and we find higher paid focus on total comp
and not benefits . benefits are the one thing we keep the same for all of
citigroup and we don ' t want to do anything with subsidy or anything else .
happy to discuss futher how we market overall comp . and ben . philosphy to
deal with the benefits .

john ,
i am worried about comparison between your and our benefits costs . perhaps
you could review and let me know if you agree we have a problem . my
recommendation is that we consider a subsidy or payrise for our people who
may otherwise suffer a hardship in meeting the additional costs of your
medical / dental premiums .

today , but i should be able to have you a spreadsheet on monday showing some
different scenarios on how netco employees paychecks would be affected
paying for their own benefits based on their salary range and coverage tier

> i ' m not sure if i read this correctly but seems to me medical costs are
significantly higher under citi groups arrangements . i ' ve asked neil and
jeanie to work with you to illustrate if they are . i may need to get them to
subsidise for first 12 months the difference , if i can prove some hardship .

> david , below is an initial draft of our current benefit plans compared to
ssmb ' s plans . the main difference is employee ' s for ssmb pay for benefits
out of pocket instead of having flexdollars cover a portion of the cost .
