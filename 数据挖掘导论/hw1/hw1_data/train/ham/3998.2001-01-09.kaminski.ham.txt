vince ,
sounds good ! it will take two or three days for me to strip out , reformat ,
and assemble the kaminski columns ( since we didn ' t do this last year , i ' m
guessing you mean all columns since the beginning ) , so i envision us being
ready with the completed set the first part of next week . i assume that you
would like me to omit those people who have moved on ?
also , on page three of the first volume , you had written an introduction . i
have updated the content for volume two , but would you perhaps like to do a
new one ?
