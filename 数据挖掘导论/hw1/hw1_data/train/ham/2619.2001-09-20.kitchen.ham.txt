Subject: cpuc votes 3 - 2 to suspend direct access after september 20
done without much fanfare , except by commissoner wood , who continued his vitriolic attack on da and took on green choice as " fraudulent . " the language in the order says no more da contracts can be entered into after today . the order directs the utilities to police the dasrs to make sure that none are submitted for contracts signed after today . there is some strange language that talks about a possible future order to address the comments raised by the parties and putting parties " on notice " that , in this future order , they may suspend all direct access contracts signed on or after july 1 , 2001 . our attorneys are reviewing this , but on first blush , our california attorney says the cpuc would have a difficult time implementing a later retroactive suspension of da .
