Subject: revised customer list
attached is the revised list with changes you requested . i spoke with frank vickers about a few of the entries to ensure they were not duplicates with regards to cities and their departs . he advised that we would consider them two customers .
example : talahassee , city of
talahassee electric this would greatly assist with sorting the information . after your review i can send back to the gas teams and ask them to populate some of the missing data if you wish .
regards ,
