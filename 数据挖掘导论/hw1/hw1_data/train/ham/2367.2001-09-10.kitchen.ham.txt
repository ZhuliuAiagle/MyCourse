Subject: message forwarded from keyspan
louise ,
this social e - mail is from rich montenes who runs the entire gas control room for keyspan . we worked together diligently on the first year of the brooklyn transaction and i focused on his organization as critical to daily flexibility for enron . we have kept in touch over the last 4 years . as we discussed today , the mpsc ( michigan public service commission ) wanted to " verify " with brooklyn our record .
as he stated from below :
i will give enron a stunning recommendation to your potential future customer - rest assured ! it ' s an easy thing for me because i ' m very sincere about it . our working relationship with coral is non - existent . nothing like enron from my point of view .
i believe aquila may be our competition on this deal with coral being in the outside lane . kevin fox , head of trading at aquila , is an ex - employee of chuck and has been spending a significant amount of time with him .
just an fyi . . .
laura
and the term we were both trying to remember is " stalking - horse " .

laura ,
always good to hear from you . i ' ve asked bobby several times how you are so i know you ' re well . hope being back in houston agrees with you . as far as a chance of seeing you on thursday / friday - i ' ll be in hershey pa . with our friends at duke ( customer / golf meeting ) . if you find yourself up and about ny some other time please let me know if you have some spare time . i would love to see you .
my oldest daughter won the hamilton fellowship at columbia university law school . she started in august . that ' s great but i find she doesn ' t have much time for her old man as she ' s apparently knee deep in work . sound familiar ? the good news is it ' s not costing me anything and i can put up with it to save $ 100 , 000 . 00 + .
great news about di - she certainly deserves to be recognized for her talents . she was lucky to have you as a mentor !
i will give enron a stunning recommendation to your potential future customer - rest assured ! it ' s an easy thing for me because i ' m very sincere about it . our working relationship with coral is non - existent . nothing like enron from my point of view .
yes - we still have roasted pepper pizza ' s nearby !
stay well and give those 4 going on 10 babies a kiss for me .
