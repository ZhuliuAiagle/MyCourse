subject : recommendation of an outstanding baylor mba student for summer
internship
dear stinson ,
i would like to call your attention to rusty parks , who is an mba student
here and has been serving as my research assistant since last fall . ? rusty is
a very outstanding individual with a very impressive work ethic and interest
in topics such as financial engineering and technology , particularly as these
issues pertain to the energy industry . ? ? in fact , you met rusty during your
recent visit to baylor ( specifically , last month over dinner at the gamma
iota sigma chartering ceremony ) .
i happen to know that rusty is already scheduled to visit enron for an
interview for a summer internship on april 19 . ? he has been invited by althea
gordon . ? if there is any possibility that you could meet with him during his
visit , i am sure that he would be most grateful . ? rusty is one of the very
best research assistants i have ever had , and i am sure that enron would
benefit from having him aboard during the coming summer .
sincerely ,
jim garven
