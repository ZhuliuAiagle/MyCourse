thanks - eric mentioned that dynegy had been pursuing him . we did however sign up eric on a
three year agreement last week . too bad about jonathon but given his back to back
experiences in japan and lng it was probably a good move on his part .

heads up , i spoke to jonathon this evening . i confirmed that dynegy had been speaking to eric shaw at length . i think the only reason jonathan got the job was that he asked for less money .
speak soon
