we have the aig highstar fund in ena . as i understand it ena committed to $ 12 . 5 m on this with the other 50 % coming from ee & cc . i understand from dave that you are taking the p & l swings on this fund . as they are about to pull further on this money ( < 1 m to date ) , i wondered how you wanted it treating .
let ' s discuss
