subject : visit from stanford ?
dear dr . kaminski ,
let me briefly introduce myself , i am the director of corporate relations
for the school of engineering at stanford university . in this role , i am
always on the watch for ways to bring our faculty together with companies
that have an appetite for engagement with top tier research institutions .
i believe you know hill huntington , who is a senior researcher with
stanford ' s energy modeling forum . he suggested i get in touch with you for
some ideas about contacts at enron . i ' m in the process of planning a trip
to texas in early may along with my colleague donna lawrence , the
university ' s director of corporate relations . we were hoping to be able to
include a stop at enron on our itinerary . right now it appears that friday ,
may 4 th would work best for us but we ' re at the very beginning of our trip
planning .
the purpose of our visit would be to review the current relationship
between enron and stanford , to give you an overview of current priorities
in the school of engineering , and ask for your help in identifying the best
points of contact .
i look forward to hearing from you about your availability ,
sincerely ,
susan hansen
