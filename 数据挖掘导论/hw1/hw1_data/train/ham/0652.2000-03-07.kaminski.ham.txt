john ,
we are currently not modelling the effect of insurance on eastern on an
individual risk basis . i have spoken at length with houston research &
credit risk management on this given that the portfolio of risk is
dynamic , specific allocation of protection is not appropriate . as i mentioned
in my earlier message there is $ 135 mm cap on any one loss , assuming no losses
have occured prior to that .
i am happy to discuss this further with you if required .
bill , i ' d appreciate any comments you may have re . the above .
regards ,
soma

the protection is not a fixed allocation of protection to individual
counterparties but covers the global portfolio of risk . enron has in place 3
tranches of credit insurance covering up to $ 135 mm per event . whilst the
insurance is not counterparty specific , it would be available for credit loss
on eastern provided that losses had not been incurred prior to an eastern
loss . i have already discussed with houston credit risk management at this
point in time there has been no resolution in finding an appropriate way to
allocate protection by name .
summary of insurance :
enron absorbs the first $ 10 mm of losses in any one year capped at the
aggregate of $ 30 mm over a ten year period .
aegis absorbs the next $ 35 mm of losses for the same ten year period .
chubb will pick up the next $ 50 mm losses for any single event and $ 100 mm in
losses in the aggregate for 5 years
rsa takes the next $ 50 mm for losses in excess of $ 95 mm over a five year
period & covers the top 9 counterparties by exposure
