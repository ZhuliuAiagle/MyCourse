clayton -
sorry it took so long to get back to you . there are a couple of things to
keep in mind :
- enron it supports enron equipment .
- all equipment must be purchased through " enron it purchasing "
our current high end desktop is a 800 mhz pentium iii machine with 128 m of
ram . you can bump up the ram to whatever you feel is appropriate . when the lghz processors come out ( in the very near future ) that will become our
standard .
what we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for .
the " image " is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when
it is deployed . if you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image
for , we can ' t support it for a multitude of reasons .
hopefully this answered your questions / concerns .
if not , please call me so that we can discuss this further .
thanks

i have developed a model for enron that requires ultra - high - end pc
performance ( it does many calculations in excel ) , and my boss has authorized
me to buy whatever pc i need . i ' m looking at the compaq 850 , but richard ( our
floor rep ) says no pc ' s over the 600 series will be supported by it . i need
to resolve this issue ; we are sophisticated buyers , we know the type of
machine we want , and we have the money to pay for it .
sincerely ,
