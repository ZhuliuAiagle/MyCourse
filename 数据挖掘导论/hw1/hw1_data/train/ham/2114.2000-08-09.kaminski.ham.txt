Subject: a chapter to be published in a book by clewlow / strickland
darrell ,
grant masson , ronnie chahal and myself made a contribution to the book
on energy derivatives to be published soon in australia ( a book by
clewlow and strickland ) .
given our growing workload and responsibilities , the quality of the paper is
less
than satisfactory . i would like to make sure that there are no obvious and
embarrassing errors in what we submit . i would appreciate if you could
take a quick look at the chapter and give us the feedback ( under the same
arrangement as in the previous cases ) .
thanks for looking at our storage model . i shall give you a call within the
next few days to update you on our work and developments at enron .
vince will start his senior year in 6 weeks . he wants to graduate and look
for work : he thinks getting an advanced degree in his field makes
no economic sense . he spent the summer building his
own computer ( 1000 mhz clock speed ) . i was the unskilled immigrant worker
toiling under his management .
i hope everything is well at home and that your wife ' s company is doing great .
regards .
vince
