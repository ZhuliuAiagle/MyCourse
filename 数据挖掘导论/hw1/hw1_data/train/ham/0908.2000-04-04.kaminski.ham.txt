dear ms . crenshaw ,
i am very glad to see professor kaminski let me meet with him . i offer to
visit you around 3 p . m . on 17 th monday . i wonder if we can invite him for a
dinner that night because my colleague mr . yamada who also wishes to meet
with him will attend a risk publication ' s seminar up to 5 p . m . on that day .
please let professor kaminski know we understand this offer may affect on
his private time and we do not insist on it . i am very much looking forward
to seeing him .
best regards ,
