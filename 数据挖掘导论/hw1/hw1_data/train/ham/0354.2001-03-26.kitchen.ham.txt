billy ,
several things i am hoping to go over with you monday pm , but main thing is that ena otc is concerned that the names currently slated for the a & a prc don ' t make sense .
louise has asked me to call them and see if each are keen to do it , but main objection was the number of people from power trading being distracted at their busiest time of the year . i told louise that i was sure if we wanted to switch one or two around you wouldn ' t mind , however , i would confirm with you before suggesting alternates .
