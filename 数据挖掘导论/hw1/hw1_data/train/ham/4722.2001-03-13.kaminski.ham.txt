Subject: henwood & psim
stinson / vince ,
the henwood runs for dabhol are , at least temporarily , over . however , the
main modeller for henwood ( david yumigada ) works out of their california
office .
it maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs , and
explain the modelling algorithm to the larger group .
in aparticular , now that i am going through some of the comments people have
raised on the psim model , i think there is value in understanding the way
henwood deals with hot and cold starts , ramp up costs , and with issues of
cycling plants .
i think understanding these will help in developing the next version of the
psim , and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models .
this is a suggestion , and so please let me know if you see value in this .
regards ,
sandeep .
