Subject: re : important - prc mtg
hi dorn & john , as you discovered recently , i am still ' officially ' in vince
kaminski ' s group ( my original enron corp . group ) . this holds true for shalesh
ganjoo as well . i did not explicitly pick dorn or john as reviewers thinking
that they will show up automatically as a result of my assumed reporting
structure .
so , vince has agreed to ' host ' the review in his group and proceed to
transfer me over to ebs officially when this quarter is overs ( apprently that
was scheduled to be automatic ) . in the mean time , vasant , stinson or vince
would like to get a e - mail from either dorn or john regarding my performance
from their perspective for consideration as soon as possible .
i had plan on being on vacation starting tomorrow and have made arrangement
with my family already . since i am not reviewing shalesh directly ( since he
is in research under stionson ) , i am assuming i don ' t have to attend the
review meetin tommorrow . i ' ll be on the road starting in the morning . if i
change this , i am told at home , that i will be in the market for another
family ! i can phone in if that is okay .
kayla , could you page me with the details ?
regards ,
ravi .
