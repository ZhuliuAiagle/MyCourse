vince ,
i ' m glad you liked it . my next " enron " task is to try and develop a better
understanding of the way you describe the use of btu swaps to create a
synthethic multi - fuel plant . i understand the basic concept but want to
learn more about the swaps ( duration , cost , etc ) which will impact a
company ' s decision to build a single vs multi - fuel generator . do you have
some example transactions or analyses that i might look over to learn more ?
see ya in april ( we ' re going to learn to " rope " calves this year ) .
your friend ,
john
