subject : gas trading move november 9
john has asked for a communication to go out to the gas team about the move this weekend . ina rangel has been communicating with the gas team already on most of these items .
here is a draft , please have john or louise " bless this " before sending out . if you already have a distribution list that includes power , it probably won ' t hurt for everyone to receive .
as you are all aware , the ena gas organization will be relocating to enron center south this weekend .
the new facility will be available to you at 5 : 00 am on monday november 12 . weather traders will be expected earlier and arrival time has been coordinated separately with the it support team . we would like for all traders to be at their new desks at least one hour earlier than usual to ensure that all applications are operating correctly prior to the start of business .
there will be members of the it , telephony , and churn team on hand upon your arrival to assist with any problems you may encounter . they will be wearing brightly colored vests to be easily recognizable .
thanks in advance for helping make this a smooth transition to an exciting new work environment .
john and louise
