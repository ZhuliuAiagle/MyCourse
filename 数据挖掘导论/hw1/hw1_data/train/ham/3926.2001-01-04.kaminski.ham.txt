subject : tiger team event
hello team ,
i hope that everyone had a wonderful and restful holiday season .
down to business : the university affairs group is putting together a tiger
team of students to do a project for enron . those students will be in town
on january 18 th and will be having dinner at churrasco ' s that night . i think
it would be a great opportunity for some of the wharton alum to come out and
meet the participants , talk about enron and eat some good food . : - ) if you
are interested in participating please rsvp to me via email or at extension
53214 no later than 1 / 5 / 01 .
thank you and hope to see you soon ,
kristin gandy
