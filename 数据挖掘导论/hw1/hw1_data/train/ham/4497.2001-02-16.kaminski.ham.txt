Subject: howard confirmation
hi vince , i ' m on vacation from friday ( today ) until tuesday . rachel / london
sent me this confirmation last night and think it illicts your attention - did
they get it right to meet you satisfaction ? i hope your interview goes well
with howard too . it ' s all set .
any feedback on the guys from ford credit and citigroup / oxford university ? i
own them outright - no other firms involved ! fyi : my fees are always much less
on these candidates ( exclusive ownership by myself ) as there are no middlemen
involved from these " other firms " . i luckily have been attracting very
talented candidates with just doing business " as myself " rather than mri . i
am very encouraged . please check them out , vince . . . as you know - i always
send you them first then on to my other clients - if you reject them .
bye vince , thank you for the business !
jeff
