Subject: mhi turbines
louise ,
brett wiggs is requesting approval for $ 300 , 000 in net spend related to what appears to be change orders and a new storage plan for the mhi turbines . the dash indicates that this request is made in the name of " enron americas " .
is this something that you have discussed with brett ? in your view , would this be an enron americas matter or an egs matter ? who presently owns p / l responsibility for the turbines ? at present , egs is now listed as the " controlling party " on the turbine position report .
in any case , i ' m fairly certain that a full dash would not be needed here - - an i - dash would be sufficient and i can work with brett on that .
regards ,
