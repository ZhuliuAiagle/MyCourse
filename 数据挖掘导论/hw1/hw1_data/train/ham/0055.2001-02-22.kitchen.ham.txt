first , congratulations on your resent position change . sounds like an
exciting and challenging opportunity for you .
second , you may have already heard but i just wanted to touch base with you
and give you an update on waterdesk . american water works on friday
notified
us that they have decided to pass on the acquisition of waterdesk . this is
unfortunate for both the industry and waterdesk as a whole . we are
immediately positioning wd to sell the individual assets as feasible and
have severed the team effective 3 / 16 / 01 . thank you for providing the names
of your directors within networks , the team has been in contact with the
various names you provided us . alex and myself will be remaining to work
with various systems integrators and any other potential purchasers
interested in the " parts " of waterdesk during the next several weeks .
and finally on a personal note , i was incredibly impressed with you and the
way you carried yourself during our meeting last month . it was refreshing
to speak to someone as high energetic as you and to talk to someone who
really " get ' s it " at enron . i ' d be interested if you had any opportunities
and / or suggestions for an individual such as myself given my background in
developing and executing new business strategies for clients in the
consulting arena and most recently leading the waterdesk from a product to
a
services focused company .
i look forward to any suggestions you may have . regards , karen welsch .
