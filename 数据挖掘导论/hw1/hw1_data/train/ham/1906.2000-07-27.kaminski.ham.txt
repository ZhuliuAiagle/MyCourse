i think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2 - 3
years from commercial production . ideally , we could get that confirmation
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest
in its success . their technology pitch sounded good , but i don ' t know enough
to recognize the potential shortcomings . i want to feel comfortable that you
all feel this is real , then i would be happy to have me and my team spend
some time with them .

thank you for participating in yesterday ' s meeting . we spoke with harvey and
jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart .
there is an opportunity for enron to participate with mec in the early
development of their company , but it seems the one thing they want is the one
thing we also want , people . i would appreciate your thoughts and comments on
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with mec as
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship . given our
resource constraints , this would most likely be part of the organization that
sees the greatest strategic impact from mec ' s development .
