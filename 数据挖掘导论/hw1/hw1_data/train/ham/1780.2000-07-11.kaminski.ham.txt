Subject: timesheets
hello everyone :
well it is almost that time again ! i am going to try something different . i
am
forwarding you the time sheet by email . save the document to whatever
drive you want to and then fill out any off duty time or overtime that you
had
and return to me by email . i will need this by the 15 and 30 ( or 31 st ) of
each
month .
this may work better than hand delivering .
let me know what you think .
