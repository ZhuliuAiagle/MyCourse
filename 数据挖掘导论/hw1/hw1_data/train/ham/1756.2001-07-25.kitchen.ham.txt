Subject: california update 7 / 25 / 01 - - - - meeting w / assembly on its latest
version of edison mou
adding to kristin ' s update , here ' s the summary of a meeting that just occured with assembly leadership staff and industry on the assembly ' s latest version of an " edison mou " :
the speaker ' s staffer said that if he had to bet at this time , he would bet that the assembly would not convene on friday .
he also said that , if it doesn ' t happen on friday , nothing will happen until they get back from recess on the 20 th of august .
the assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether they intend to move forward with a vote on friday or recess .
from the most recent proposal released today by the assembly leadership , it appears that the centrist democrats are prevailing . the proposal :
retains direct access ( though they said that they are continuing to be pressured by the treasurer , who wants da suspended due to the bond issuance )
places 80 % of edison ' s past debt with large customers ( leaving 20 % with small customers , which business customers or strenuously opposing ) .
eliminates all references to any purchase , or option to purchase , edison ' s transmission . ( they said there simply ain ' t the votes to buy , or consider buying , edison ' s transmission in the assembly )
maintains the senate provision , which would pay the banks , pay the qfs , but place with edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $ 1 billion owed to suppliers . ( even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions . )
creates a tradeable , renewable portfolio standard ( conceptually similar to the one created in texas ) .
the new bill is created by 1 ) amending sb 78 and 2 ) gutting a different bill passed from the senate to the assembly , sb 39 , and replacing it with the new version of 82 xx . the two would go together to create the assembly ' s newest proposal .
if this bill gets voted out of the assembly , it will likely have a difficult time getting the votes necessary to pass in the senate , since the senate has considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the assembly version .
will report back on whether the assembly ' s going forward or adjourning for recess as soon as we hear .
best ,
jeff

details are still rough and the situation is very fluid , but here is what is currently going on :
senators hertzberg and keeley are amending both sb 78 xx and ab 82 xx . upon an initial read , it appears that they are doing the following :
? ab 82 xx has been gutted except for the direct access provisions and the renewables portfolio . ( the core / non - core business provisions , the transmission asset purchase , etc . all appear to have been deleted . ) both of these provisions that have been left in the bill were seen as positive by members last week when the bill was first debated .
? it appears amendments have been made to sb 78 xx but the extent of these changes are not yet known .
? at the beginning of both amended bills , it states , " as proposed to be amended into sb _ xx . " this means that amendments to sb 78 could be incorporated into ab 82 , and vice versa . another possibility is an entirely new bill .
