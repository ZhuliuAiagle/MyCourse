just finished meeting with pual , vince & mark
new plan :
let ' s plan on your coming to houston march 12 th - april 2 nd ( after our
summer / winters respectively
but . .
let ' s proceed with the project without pause :
1 . please send up the software that needs to be installed along with
operating system requirements
2 . please copy me on forecasting provided to sydney office on a daily basis
if we work on these two fronts , it will optimize your time here and permit
transotion to cover your forecasting there
