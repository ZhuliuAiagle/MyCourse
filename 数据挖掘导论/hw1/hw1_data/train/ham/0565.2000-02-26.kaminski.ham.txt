Subject: risk magazine - enron sponsored issue on energy derivatives
i have recently come on board as treasurer , enron india . prior to joining ,
i was with reliance industries , a petrochemical conglomerate in india .
the central banking authorities are now thinking of permitting
corporates to hedge their oil and other related risks . i believe the
literature published
by risk in collaboration with enron has come to be considered as an
industry standard . would it be possible to arrange for two copies to be sent
across to us .
thanx n regards
