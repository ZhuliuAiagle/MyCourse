hi vince ,
i may have missed something , however don ' t believe i have received any
communication recently from andy festow about this upcoming may 4 - 5 corp .
fin . conference . i hope he is still planning to come , yet i don ' t know as
of now .
i have andy penciled in as a participant on a " panel " that is discussing
equity dilution from stock option compensation ( the role of panelist should
require little , if any , preparation time ) . of course , i want andy to
come , however he is concerned about his ability to attend , i probably
should identify another person or two to serve on the panel .
dave .
