Subject: tex - mex status
steve , et al ,
what is the status of tex - mex , and who are the responsible parties ? is this an ena project , and ees project , an edm project , or is is joint ?
there has been very little communication or coordination from edm to date . word is that committments are being made by edm , and it is not certain that those committments have been shared with those who will have to fulfill them .
can you please clarify the situation ?
also , since drew tingleaf has left the company , who has been assigned to fill that role ?
if enron is going to be faced with committments on this project , it would be prudent to keep those involved informed .
perhaps there is nothing to be concerned about , but it ' s better to ask now than to find we ' ve missed something later .
thanks !
