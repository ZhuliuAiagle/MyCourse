dear youyi :
the person in charge of external grants in your company needs to contact
nsf by calling the following numbers for institution registration .
fastlane user support : 1 - 800 - 673 - 6188 .
fastlane availability ( recording ) : 1 - 800 - 437 - 7408 .
after enron is registered ( i think it ' s a free registration ) , you provide
the following information to the enron official so he / she will send it to nsf .
nsf will assign you a password for future access to electronic submission
( called fastlane ) . since all proposals have to be submitted through
fastlane after oct . 1 , 2000 , this is the must .
name
highest degree
year conferred
present institution
department
street address

social security number ( ssn )
