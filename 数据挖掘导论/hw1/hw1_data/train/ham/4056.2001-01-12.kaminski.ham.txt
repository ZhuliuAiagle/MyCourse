Subject: first derivatives class
bob ,
i have asked martin , zimin , and paulo to prepare short presentations on the
power , gas , and crude markets , respectively . this will take probably 45
minutes of class time . in addition i will prepare some lecture
material . if we don ' t have enough class time to cover all assigned
problems , we can just roll them to the next class .
thanks ,
stinson
