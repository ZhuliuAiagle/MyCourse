Subject: re : keep thinking i ' ll see you when you get back
thanks for the positive feedback - i ' m glad everything went well . when i called kristen & rich on thursday evening - it sounded like everyone was having a grand time ! !
trip to germany was fun , but hectic . it ' s hard to put so much into only 10 days .
looking forward to handling your next event ( and this time i ' ll make sure i ' m in town ) .
by the way - how did the videos turn out ? ?
