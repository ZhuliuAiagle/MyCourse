i regret to announce that sean crandall has tendered his resignation from enron . he has decided to return to his native land of utah to join duke energy ' s trading team . sean made tremendous contributions to our trading floor during the past few years . he will be sorely missed . please join me in wishing sean the best in his future endeavors .
