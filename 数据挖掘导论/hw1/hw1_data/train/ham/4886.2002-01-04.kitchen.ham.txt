saw in the wsj today that the judge allowed enron to " end " 600 - 700 supply
contracts . is that ees ? if so are they going to still be in business ? i ask
because of my question from yesterday re the annual load carve - out . is there
anything left to carve out ? ?
thanks
rick

the following documents are the two agreements which facilitate the online
trading . these contracts govern the actual transaction process and are
accepted the counterparty either in writing or electronically .
password application - in writing
electronic trading agreement - electronically
these documents do not have any customer specific terms ( eg credit etc ) as
they are not intended to govern the underlying commodity transactions , but
simply the utiliszation of the website . the general terms and conditions
will be issued to the known buyer as they do have credit terms etc .
please let me , dave forster or mark taylor know if you would require further
information .
