Subject: re : do you have any responsibility for the barges ?
louise :
no - but they are probably a good candidate for the restructuring group . they were originally 9 barges that were owned by calme ( d . haug ) and were being shopped around enron for a home . some of them went to a power project in nigeria and now their are two of them left without a home .
last year they were being considered for a lipa deal on long island that was orginally proposed by r . maffett / r . tapscott . janet d . was working on this deal before she left for ees - but i don ' t think she made any further progress . as i recall the ownership of the barges came from the calme organization into mike mcconnell ' s - egm group as part of the split of calme assets .
