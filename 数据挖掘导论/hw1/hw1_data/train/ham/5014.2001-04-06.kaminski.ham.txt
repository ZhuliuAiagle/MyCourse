rakesh ,
can you please take a look at this write up that i put together last night .
i would like to get your comments this morning if possible . i am trying to
see if we can use this as a discussion tool with some investment banks to get
their comments as to the reasonableness of the restriction calculated .
also , thanks for your assistance with andersen yesterday . they should be
directing all of their questions / comments to me so i can intermediate with
you and the rest of the research group . please let me know if they start
calling you with questions or want to set up any meetings .
regards ,
ryan
