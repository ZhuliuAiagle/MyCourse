Subject: re : prospective 6 / 22 houston visit
professor ronn :
thank you for your email and i wish to respond as follows :
i have left a message with our travel agency asking if they can get you a
hotel reservation closer into town . i will let you know .
i have ordered an overhead projector and the room already has a screen
installed . however , there is really not room for a lectern . the overhead
will
sit on the end of the large conference table and most have room to use part
of the table for their presentation copies .
i will be glad to make copies for you , however , it would be a big help if you
could email me a copy of your presentation on wednesday . thursday
mornings around here get pretty hectic sometimes and we may not have
time to make the copies .
i hope this meets with your approval . please let me know if you need
anything else .
we look forward to your visit .
regards ,
shirley crenshaw
