$ 1 , 828 , 214 ( fundings made in 12 \ 00 and 2 \ 01 )
fair value of alamac investment on ena ' s books : $ 22 , 000 , 000
origination taken on original fv mark = $ 14 , 522 , 411 ( 50 \ 50 ena and eim ) *
* issue : in the lq origination we built up the " basis " for certain capital improvements and the expected net operating loss of the plant through april , which was the anticipated sale date to aig . we now have the actual losses through 6 \ 30 to deal with . i will send you a separate schedule with the details but basically we are looking @ $ 1 . 2 million that needs to be shared with eim . these losses do not automatically flow there as ncph is an unconsolidated entity .
estimated upside on power option $ 1 . 7 million ( on hotlist for 3 q ) premium coming to us is around $ 3 . 5 million . ( ? )
pv of coal supply deal on egm ' s books is $ 4 , 325 , 000 asset .
