natural gas markets in mexico
natural gas demand in mexico in the coming years could grow by up to 8 %
annually . such demand could lead to natural gas imports approaching 2 bcf
per day , according to government forecasts . in response , pemex proposes two
actions : the first consists of measures to increase cross - border pipeline
infrastructure and capacity such as a new pipeline being built by coral
energy into pemex ' s supply hub at reynosa . the possibility of a new
pipeline to monterrey is still an option . a second measure is to implement
a gas - centric exploration and production program focused on five areas , two
of which are dry natural gas basins , burgos and macuspana . this second
measure is intended to reduce projected imports by up to 80 % . at present ,
pemex ' s 10 - year strategic plan does not contemplate a role for private
production companies in capacities other than that of technical assistance .
