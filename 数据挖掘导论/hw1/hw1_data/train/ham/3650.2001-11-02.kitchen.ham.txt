Subject: we are doing ok
it ' s the week - end ! this is just a general overview , if anyone wants detail , please give me a ring .
in general we are doing ok . in terms of cash out the door today , we were actually going to be positive until kinder morgan refused to send our cash back . we should be ( $ 5 . 81 mm ) .
cut us off :
1 . fpl ( balance of month transactions only )
2 . enbridge ( consumers )
3 . proliance

6 . apache
7 . pseg ( physical gas sales only )
10 . powerex ( cash and real time only )
11 . salt river project
12 . pacificorp ( northwest cash only )
issues :
1 . pjm interconnection llc - want $ 30 mm lc , we are working with them on their calculation methodology . awaiting a letter before we react .
2 . aep - we completed $ 50 mm of assignment transactions with them on friday night . we also sent them $ 50 mm earlier in the week when they had no contractual rights to it . they ' ll be back on monday ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! they have not cut us . they blinked first ! ! ! ! !
3 . mirant - still want the physical gas collateralized . we have offered to sell it to them . they are still scheduling .
4 . ngx - they have taken our lines to zero . peter keohane is working on it .
5 . sempra - sempra are still trading but wanting to take their positions to zero .
6 . spinnaker - we may have agreed to monetize a position and therefore pay out $ 3 mm plus .
7 . kinder morgan - asked for collateral for the first time ( $ 39 mm ) . sent a letter suggesting material breach of contract , we have responded by letter to park shaper cfo .
8 . conoco contract - equiva ( we gave it to them ) , apache , conoco , pogo , sempra , conagra , vitol have all attempted to get collateral under the adequate assurance clause .
9 . gisb - we appear to have been confirming some transactions under the gisb rather than the masters . this is causing problems as it includes the ' adequate assurances ' clause . w & t offshore inc , mirant , devon , sequent . letters have been sent .
