michael
i have got csfb working on the amendment you asked for .
in the meantime we have produced a graph which shows , as indices , market
values of the water companies and the rab of the industry since
privatisation . the following points come out
1 market values overtime have been 1 . 1 x rab
2 the result is significantly skewed by the period between mid 1997 and end
1998 when the ratio was cl . 5 x .
3 the premium to rab is only found at a time when political uncertainty has
been removed the companies are able to outperform the regulatory deal
significantly . those days are gone - a fact witnessed by the decline in
share prices in the last year
just to note that the graph we have produced here is a weighted average of
water companies - whereas the figures we did yesterday on the rab market
value ratio is a straight average . obviously that influences the numbers a
little .
on customerco . csfb have contacted around 7 energy companies . the result
has been positive and they are prepared to enter our journal exercise . i
await a revised fee proposal but csfb have been advised that it should be
more modest than the last one !
