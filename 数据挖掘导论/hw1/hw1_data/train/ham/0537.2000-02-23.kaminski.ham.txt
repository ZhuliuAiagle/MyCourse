Subject: re : kmi end - user license agreement ( enron ' s agreement for project
services
hi gene , looks like you are dealing with the subject . thanks for moving this
forward . kmi is dancing around relatively minor issues that i think we should
be able to overcome . essentially , the issue is that we will not resell their
database or misrepresent it . they want to put in all this restriction about
not using it for trading , exchange , etc . stretches our possible usage of this
database . it appears from your e - mail that the attament therein is our
standard agreement that we get our vendors to sign . at this point , i am
happy with whatever it takes to get those guys to close the deal .
thank you very much for the prompt service ,
regards ,
ravi .
