Subject: pricing default and our may 22 conference call
>
dear vince :
i spoke with ms crenshaw yesterday afternoon about a conference call about
developing internet course material . if you have already discussed this
with your colleagues , it might be helpful if you could very briefly outline
the questions and issues they might raise in the conference call so that i
can be a bit better prepared .
ms crenshaw also mentioned that you never received my earlier email
regarding the credit spread model i developed with stathis and sergey . my
earlier email follows , and the nondisclosure agreement is attached .
i look forward to talking with you next week .
regards ,
sheridan
