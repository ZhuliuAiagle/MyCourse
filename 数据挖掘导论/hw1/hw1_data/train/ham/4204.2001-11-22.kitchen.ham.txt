louise ,
i think we should try to sell some of our in the money positions . bradford did not want to pursue this when we were doing the ring trades for aep , but now it seems as though we should do it simply to raise cash .
if we are short npl 5 and we have an in the money sale to a muni that does not post collateral , we could sell that customer contract to cash - rich marketers - allegheny , duke , aep , dynegy
i know it is our core business , but it might be quicker than selling brazil .
target customers : munis , wapa , bpa ,
