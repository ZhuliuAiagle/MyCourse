Subject: re : gtv weekly status update
hi louise ,
i tried to call a moment ago , but unfortunately you were engaged in a meeting .
i wanted to let you know that the message from you below has caused some concern with my team , as they are struggling to see how they can accomplish this to your satisfaction by end of this week , and geoff storey himself was wondering how we could even get to transport valuation in erms in that time frame .
they are heading for a draft by the end of the week , but feel extremely uncomfortable about committing to timing and full scope untill they have had more time to work through it .
could you please let me know if you are expecting a signed document at the end of this week ? . . . . . . or can i let them issue a draft to be firmed up next week instead ?
best regards
steve

i ' m a bit confused - i think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small . i would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following .
single deal entry revisions
options reports
transport valuation in erms
eol reporting tools ( possible )
i would like to see phase ii include the items above and an inception document re - issued this week .
thanks
louise
