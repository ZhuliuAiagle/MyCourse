as an additional follow - up , as part of the approval process , i was told that ena and ee & cc have the right to opt out of this fund at any time during the first twelve months without cause and without penalty . if this is something that neither you nor dave want to do , then i suggest exercising this option .

we have the aig highstar fund in ena . as i understand it ena committed to $ 12 . 5 m on this with the other 50 % coming from ee & cc . i understand from dave that you are taking the p & l swings on this fund . as they are about to pull further on this money ( < 1 m to date ) , i wondered how you wanted it treating .
let ' s discuss
