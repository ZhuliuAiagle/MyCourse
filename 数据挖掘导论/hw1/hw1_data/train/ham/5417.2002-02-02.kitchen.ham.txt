Subject: day 1 list additions
as per my email from yesterday ;
attached are pipeline companies , transmission company ( ercot ) and canadian companies not on the prior " louise approved " list which credit has been working on .
we have been having difficulty tracking down the full legal name for some of the storage and transmission companies , and for aec storage , there are two names - i assume only one may be required . for any cases where the full legal name cannot be found today , we have included the group name . we will resolve the remaining full legal names on monday morning , when other staff are available .
