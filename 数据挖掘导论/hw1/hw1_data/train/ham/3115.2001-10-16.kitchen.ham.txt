geoff : i understand that i need to get with you to approve the portion of my budget that is allocated the enron america ' s . currently $ 299 , 871 is budgeted for allocation to ea . my group coordinates jv activities as well as conducting due diligence on it areas related to aquisitions and divestitures . the amount budgeted above is for the following known projects :
coordination and operations under the bridgeline it services agreement
due diligence related to project sugarcane and how we may monetize our investment in bridgeline
in 2002 ena will bill bridgeline $ 1 , 250 , 000 for it services . since chevron / texaco covers 60 % of the bill ena will net $ 750 , 000 in revenue for the services coordinated by my group .
let me know if you ' d like to get together and discuss this in any detail .
