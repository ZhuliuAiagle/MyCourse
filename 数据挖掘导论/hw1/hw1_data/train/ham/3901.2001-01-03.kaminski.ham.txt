Subject: raptor position reports for 12 / 28 / 00
attached are the latest available daily position report files for the 4
raptor vehicles which include spreadsheets detailing what is hedged within
each vehicle . one thing that i forgot to mention in our meeting yesterday is
that there is considerable indecision as to whether or not raptor 4 will be
included in the cross - guarantees , so we will need to have a value with or
without raptor 4 . i will send a follow - up e - mail with the latest drafts
available for the cross guarantees . let me know as questions arise . thanks
again .
