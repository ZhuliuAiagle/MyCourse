stinson ,
i add the total p / l due to contract rollover . when the number of trades is
large
and the spread is not too small , the model prints a lot of money , dominated by
those trade earning the half of bo spread .
i also wrote an explaination about the model on the front page . i think we
are
ready to deliever the model v . 1 .
