louise ,
we are thrilled that you will meet us at the cathedral house facility and join us for the debriefing session ( if you don ' t go into labor before tomorrow ! ) . since the rest of the group will be going to cathedral house from the knowledge beginnings katy facility on the van , do you need directions to cathedral house from enron ? if not , we look forward to meeting you at cathedral house .
i have visited the knowledge beginnings bp facility , but since the enron child care center will be closer to the new knowledge beginnings katy facility , the katy facility was selected as one of our tour stops .
i look forward to meeting you tomorrow !
regards ,

i have a few meetings on thursday but i have already recently visited the facilities of creme de la creme and attended the presentation of knowledge beginnings at enron . i will attend the cathedral house facility and debriefing session . i would suggest that you may wish to consider actually visiting the bp facility which is not an open facility ( company specific ) as this may be more akin to what we will get .
i could give you my choice now ( its easy ) but i will wait until the debriefing session .
regards
louise
( if i go into labour before thursday - sarah davis already knows my choice ! ) .
