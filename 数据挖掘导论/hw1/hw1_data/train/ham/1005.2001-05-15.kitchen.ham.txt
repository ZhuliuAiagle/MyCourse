not sure if you want me to send you updates or not ? i sent you a copy of the latest hpl status report and i have been keeping john l . up to speed . the critical path is the texas ag ' s request that aep execute a protocol describing how they will comply with existing regulations governing intrastate pipelines in texas . aep is currently in discussion with the texas ag and we will meet with aep on wed / thursday . our gain / loss on sale picture for hpl is the same as when you left ( e . g . we will meet plan ) .
i have also attached a summary of the key tech services deals .
hope things are going well at home .
