the execution of complicated transactions in which enron capital is being
deployed . this may consist of executing the funding of specific transactions
in either the bank or capital markets . currently the team is focusing on the
creation of several off - balance sheet funding vehicles that can be drawn upon
to fund multiple transactions , as well as the financing of the recently
announced daishowa acquisition . in addition , the group is focusing on the
creation of an inventory finance vehicle that can be utilized to fund
multiple steel ( or other commodity ) inventory financings . bill brown leads

financial engineering skills developed around enron creates a competitive
advantage to transaction teams and will allow us to develop new products and

news from the global flash
weather deal
enron has traded a weather derivative deal with the rock garden restaurant in
london ' s covent garden . based on a ' cold day ' index , the deal protects the
rock garden from a summer that has too many days below a certain temperature
between march and june . once a number of days has been reached , the rock
garden will receive a payout for each further day below that reference
temperature . the payouts have been weighted to reflect the greater earning
potential in some months compared to others . in a blind auction , enron beat
six other risk takers to price the deal .
