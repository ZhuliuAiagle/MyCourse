louise ,
the design members will get a room for some of tonight and the entire day tomorrow and work through to get it down on paper , but it will be a best estimate by the time they finish and not completely definative , as that can only really happen at the end of an elaboration / design phase . . . . there is no way that they could commit to a design decision for these big - ticket items in such a short space of time without compromising the quality of those decisions .
i believe you can get a draft on you desk by the end of tomorrow , but can ' t guarantee that it can be reviewed in that time and signed , unless we acknowledge that this is an inception document and not an elaboration document . ( an inception document states intent to kick off the project , while an elaboration document fleshes out the details and a design is produced ) .
the team are trying hard to accomodate this request and i hope you will understand if they don ' t quite make it by eob friday .
regards
steve
ps : i ' ll be out of the office tomorrow at the hospital , but i can be reached on 713 - 598 - 0732 or by e - mail : steve @ thestockfamily . com

i am expecting a signed document - the phase ii document was not worthwhile . geof listed out the information / areas that he wanted to see included in it , so i asked for them to be included . it sounds as though geof and your guys need to sit down and work through it today or tomorrow .

hi louise ,
i tried to call a moment ago , but unfortunately you were engaged in a meeting .
i wanted to let you know that the message from you below has caused some concern with my team , as they are struggling to see how they can accomplish this to your satisfaction by end of this week , and geoff storey himself was wondering how we could even get to transport valuation in erms in that time frame .
they are heading for a draft by the end of the week , but feel extremely uncomfortable about committing to timing and full scope untill they have had more time to work through it .
could you please let me know if you are expecting a signed document at the end of this week ? . . . . . . or can i let them issue a draft to be firmed up next week instead ?
best regards
steve

i ' m a bit confused - i think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small . i would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following .
single deal entry revisions
options reports
transport valuation in erms
eol reporting tools ( possible )
i would like to see phase ii include the items above and an inception document re - issued this week .
thanks
louise
