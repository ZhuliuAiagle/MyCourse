the current bengalla purchase transaction for approximately $ 3 . 5 mm is approved by credit and from a cash flow standpoint . please continue to approve transactions through credit . however , for the most part we will treat the coal business , as business as usual .
thanks ,
bill

george ,
i would be happy to discuss with you . it remains critical that we manage all cash requirements as our access to capital markets has been impacted over the past few weeks . hopefully the announcement on friday will improve our ability to execute transactions like this in future , but prior to friday this was a necessary precaution . unfortunately , you are working at a different company than you were a few weeks ago .
we can discuss next week .
bill

the bengalla deal was struck after i had given ecap notice of the liquidity problems , and more importantly , without any rac involvement .
from a rac perspective this deal is still unapproved . if an invoice discount facility can be used , or some other means of performing without using enron capital then you should move forward . if these options are not available , then the issue should either be raised to louise kitchen for approval or unwound until the liquidity problems are resolved .

john :
i assume this does not apply to ectrl business , as we have not been given a reciprocal recommendation for european biz . can you confirm this ? also , can you clarify what the specific issue is with ecap that is not an issue with ectrl ? is this specific to cash flow within australian entities ?
thanks ,
stu

in light of the current situation in houston , i recommend we wait to finalize any physical coal sourcing or deliveries in the ecap business . in short , rac cannot approve any purchase or sale until the liquidity issues are resolved . hopefully by the end of the week we will know more , have things settled , and business can continue as normal .
please call me if you have any questions .
john
