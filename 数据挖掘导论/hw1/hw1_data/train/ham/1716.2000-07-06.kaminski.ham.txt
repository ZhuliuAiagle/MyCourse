Subject: new expense account forms
hello all :
along with the inception of the new sap time keeping , we also have new
expense account forms .
they will no longer use your social security number as the id on your
expense accounts , they want you to use your new employee # that was
sent to you by email to access hronline .
in order for anita and myself to continue to do your expense reports , we
will need your new employee # .
please send this number to me as soon as possible .
thanks !
