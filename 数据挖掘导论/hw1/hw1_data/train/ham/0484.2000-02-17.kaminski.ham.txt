Subject: following our stanford relationship
hi vince , i talked to tom gros today and metioned our desire to estabilish a
strategic relationship with nick bambos and his research effort . tom is very
excited about the idea and was willing to cut the check . i suggested that we
have more of a strategic relationship in mine ( enron / stanford ) and he
agreed to that as well . tom mentioned that greg whalley was interested in
estabilishing such a relationship . vince , could you follow this up and
ground this ? if you need any help in doing the leg work , i ' ll happy to do
that .
tom is excited about ebs research ' s role to support all of ebs including
bandwidth trading . he seems very interested in being our sponsor on the ebs
side . that would be very beneficial to us since he is involved in all senior
management decision through kevin hannon . vince , i would suggest that you
try to setup a meeting with kevin hannon and tom to discuss this further .
tom is also very interested in the new product development effort that larry
and i have been kicking around for some time . he wanted us to sit back and
think of structured products with better margins that blend & extend that
they are selling . he wanted to know now much more resource that we need in
that front . for this , i would like to get someone like meera natarajan . she
is an originator currently working in ees and have talked to zimin and
stinson . she is sufficiently analytical with commercial mind set to help with
new product ideas and to ground them .
regards ,
ravi .
