Subject: re : greg spaniolo resume
johnny ,
greg spaniolo seems to be better suited for work in liquid markets - - certainly
not the situation with coal and emissions . brad romiane suggested that vince
kaminski might be interested in this resume .
as far as my search goes , keep an eye out for the bs and ms - level folks .
thanks .
