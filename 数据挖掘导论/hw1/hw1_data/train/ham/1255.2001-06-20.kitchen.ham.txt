Subject: operations assignments
welcome back , again . you will have to let me know when you have baby pictures in the office - would love to see them .
last week , i orchestrated some changes within my operations organization which will free up more of my time to focus on the successful commercialization of mid and back office services . i have asked bob hall to lead operations for enron americas , with peggy hedstrom ( calgary operations ) , jeff gossett ( gas risk and south america operations ) , stacey white ( power risk ) and leslie reeves ( confirmations and settlements ) reporting directly to him . he is enthusiastic about the additional responsibility and i believe that he will do an excellent job for enron americas .
other changes include appointing kevin sweeney as head of operations for eim , with brenda herod reassigned as part of a project team that will work on the ees assimilation . i have also asked beth apollo to play a project management lead role in the assimilation of ees into ews .
i will be glad to fill you in on more details on any of these changes . the result is to give more responsibility to several key players - stretching them , but i will be there to support and coach them in their new roles if needed . plus , i can now devote significantly more time to the commercialization effort . in that regard , i did move to the 27 th floor ( next to piper ) while you were out on leave .
i wanted to share these changes with you before a memo goes out across the organization next monday . call me if you would like to discuss . - - sally
