Subject: charles chen interview
vince / tanya :
i interviewed charles today 10 : 30 am . here are my impressions :
1 ) excellent professional and managerial experience .
2 ) very good technical background .
deal valuation and
model implementation
3 ) promisses to fit very well into the group ' s culture .
the only issues i see is that he would have to leave a high level position at
his current employee .
