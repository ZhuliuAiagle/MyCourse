chris ,
my part has not changed for some time ( since early july ) .
i sent the last vintage of corrections to you when i was in sydney .
you can send the version you consider final to us just to double check .
i took the liberty of sending our chapter to darrell duffie and he liked it .
what is more important he did not find any error .
i shell send you my comments on the article for robin in a day or so .
