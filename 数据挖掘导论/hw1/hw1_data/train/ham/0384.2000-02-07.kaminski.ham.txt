dear vince ,
i have not heard from louise and assume i cannot access enrononline . as a
result , i have written what i can discern in the attached draft chapter for
the risk guide to electricity hedging . could you review the enrononline
section and let me know if i have any factual errors ? obviously , i welcome
any other comments you might have .
don ' t warry about any textual problems - - me editors will catch those .
english is , after all , my thrid language ( he said , defensively ) .
sorry i couldn ' t gain access . enrononline looks interesting and the stock
market seems to be giving you a strong pat on the back . well done .
thanks for your help .

dear vince ,
greetings from boston , where we ' re doing all we can to help keep the price
of gas high .
as i may have told you earlier , i ' m writing a " guide to electricity hedging "
for risk publications similar to the report on oil . i had planned to write a
significant section on enrononline , and in the midst of my research on the
topic was denied access by enron ' s gatekeeper . can you help get me in ?
as always , the best from here .
