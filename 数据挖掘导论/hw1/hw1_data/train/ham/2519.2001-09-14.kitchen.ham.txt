business highlights
enron global markets - coal and emissions trading
the first enron online synfuel trade occurred this past week , establishing
enrononline as the only online marketplace for synfuel . the purpose of
bringing synfuel on enrononline is to provide market transparency between
the coal / synfuel spread .
the coal cash book , which began trading only two months ago , has traded
over 2 million spot tons . the fundamental purpose of this book is to
capture short term market discrepancies , while also adding liquidity to the
spot market to further long term trading and marketing of coal .
enron energy and operational services - ena solid fuel initiative
ena started development of a coal initiative late last year to support the
electricity trading desk and to provide enron with a hedge in the event
that the cost of natural gas continues to escalate above current long term
projections . because of the culture shock associated the use of the words
' enron ' and ' coal ' in the same sentence , consideration was been given to
changing the name to dng ( dense natural gas ) ; however , we went with solid
fuel initiative .
this initiative is developing multiple sites throughout the country where
ena feels there is the greatest opportunity for long term corporate
benefit . the primary areas are texas , florida , southeastern ohio and the
central rocky mountain area . there are 2 principal areas currently being
aggressively pursued : brownsville , tx and brighton fl . in brownsville ,
the team secured formal owner approval to lease a 600 acre site near the
brownsville ship channel . this approval will allow the formal permitting
activities to proceed without delay .
a 500 mw facility is being considered for brownsville . as conceptualized ,
it will consist of two - 250 mw ( net ) cfb units ( circulating fluidized bed )
boilers . the boilers will be fired by petroleum coke ( petcoke ) and use a
technology that will generate electricity in the most environmentally
friendly way currently possible . one of the advantages of locating this
facility near brownsville is that it remains a steady growth area and there
is already serious interest by others to take substantial initial base load
capacity . there is further synergy with other developing projects in the
area that could lock down additional base capacity . as stated the plant is
initially 500 mw , but will be designed to be expanded to a 1000 mw
facility .
the eeos team is starting to grow and currently includes hilda akin &
cheryl kent , project admin assistants , bill fox as pem , and paula solomon
as pcm . as the project develops there will be more team members required .
in addition , as the florida opportunity develops we plan to establish a
separate team .
