Subject: proposed payment changes from dave forster for eol
louise -
i spoke with dave last night and he would like to propose the following changes .
stephanie sever from $ 6 , 500 to $ 7 , 000
christopher walker from $ 2 , 000 to $ 4 , 000 ( jennifer denny highly recommends , contributions not reflected in mid - year rating )
fraisy george from $ 2 , 479 to $ 3 , 000 ( used to be in call center , nature of job changed and has increased responsibility from mid - year )
adam johnson from $ 2 , 000 to $ 6 , 000 ( jennifer denny highly recommends , would take him over anyone else at his level , feels should be compensated for his contributions )
please let me know your thoughts .
