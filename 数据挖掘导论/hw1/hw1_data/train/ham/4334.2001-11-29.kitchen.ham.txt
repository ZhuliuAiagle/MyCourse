guys - we have a $ 50 mm claim riding on this - it would appear that we have nothing but upside - if we lose we won ' t pay - if we win it ' s cash to us . brobeck is owed $ 2 mm - and we obviously need to pay the experts as well .
mark - i need some guidance on this - please advise . thanks ,
george
