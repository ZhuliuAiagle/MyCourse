subject : backtesting
vince ,
i am currently implementing the backtesting features into our
risk management system . i distributed the following document at our research
meeting today ; it outlines the conventional binomial test and some other
tests , including the basle regulatory test . of course , no one test is
powerful and the efficacy of these tests breakdown for low sample sizes ,
etc . if you can think of other tests to complement these , please let me know .
regards
naveen
