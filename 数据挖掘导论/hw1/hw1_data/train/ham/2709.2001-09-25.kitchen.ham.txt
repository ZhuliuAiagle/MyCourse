enrononline has taken the energy industry by storm , irrevocably changing the way energy commodities are bought and sold . a global , easy - to - transact internet - based system , enrononline has made commodity prices more transparent and available to all players simultaneously . it has added market liquidity , lowered price spreads and given commodity traders more control than they ' ve ever had before .
the numbers alone are staggering . as of september 15 , 2001 , enrononline has completed 1 . 5 million transactions worth $ 800 billion in value , trading more than $ 5 billion on average daily . it now accounts for 60 percent of all of enron ' s trading volume .
more than 1 , 800 products are traded on enrononline in 13 currencies . products include natural gas , electricity , crude oil , coal , weather derivatives , air - emissions credits , plastics , pulp & paper , metals , steel and telecommunications bandwidth , and enron traders update their prices second by second . enrononline is truly global . through the web , it serves customers and markets in the u . s . , canada , austria , belgium , france , germany , netherlands , norway , spain , sweden , switzerland , u . k , japan and australia . enrononline is a principal - based system , which means that enron serves as counterparty in all transactions and guarantees liquidity to fulfill all buy and sell orders .
