dear dr . kaminski
my name is jaesoo lew and i am referred by dr . wayne lee .
currently i ' ve been working at aquila energy in kansas city as an pricing
analyst since july 2000 . since then , i have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options ( forest method ) pricing approach .
the price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
since a trinomial forest is required to value storage . also the c + +
programming using excel dll has been developed , too .
i attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at enron .
my home phone number is 913 - 649 - 0578 , dr . kaminski , i will wait your call in
this week as dr . lee informed me . if possible , please let me know your
expected calling day through the mail . i appreciate your consideration .
thank you very much .
sincerely ,
jaesoo lew
