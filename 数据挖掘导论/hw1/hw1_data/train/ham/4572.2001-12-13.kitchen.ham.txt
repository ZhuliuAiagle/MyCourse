note that there are trademark applications pending for 2 and 7 above , and 3 - 6 above are registered by enron europe . the sellers will agree to convey whatever rights they have in marks 2 - 7 above to newco but cannot guarantee that newco will ultimately own the marks .

c . enrononline . com / net / org : seller will agree to redirect from eol to newco for 60 days after newco site is up and running ( with a link back to eol at the newco site ) and for 120 days thereafter will provide a link on the eol site to the newco site .
d . enbank : kal proposed that newco own this mark , but greg would prefer that the estate retain this mark .
i will leave it to tim and greg to discuss this proposal from their end and then contact kal and / or dave forster to discuss . after you all have reached resolution , i would appreciate if both greg and kal could contact roger ross of weil gotshall ( 713 / 546 - 5018 or roger . ross @ weil . com ) directly to confirm the final disposition of marks and names .
please let roger know who should receive drafts of the license agreements relating to b and c above .

nancy - - as per our conversation this evening , i am attaching the e - mail i had sent to leslie hansen . i will contact leslie in the morning and determine what marks / domain names enron will allow for inclusion in the deal . i agree that if the new company is going to have a different name , it should be sufficient if enron kept the enrononline marks / domain names , but allowed their use for certain period of time to the new company . i also acknowledge your concern that granting use of the marks may be more complicated if they are owned by enron europe given that it ' s a separate entity . we will need to work out this issue depending on which entity owns the marks . i will work with leslie to research this tomorrow .
with regard to the " nice to have " trademarks in the second list below , i know that most of the domain names are owned by enron europe , not enron corp . i will research to see which entity owns the trademarks on them . if the trademarks are owned by enron europe as well , we may forgo including them in the deal for now .
please hold off any offers for trademarks / domain names your deal papers until i call to confirm our final position . i plan to speak to leslie and dave forster ( head of enrononline ) in the morning . thanks .
