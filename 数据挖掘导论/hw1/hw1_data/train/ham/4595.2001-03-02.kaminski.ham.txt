Subject: re : vlady gorny
perfect . thanks , vince .
in all likelihood , it would be just fine , it is just not customary for job
talks to include others . again , since you are a member of the risk
management chair search committee ( you may not know of this official
capacity , but i believe it is the case ) , we by all means hope that you will
be able to attend the seminar as well as dinner .
i will get details on the schedules to you early next week .
