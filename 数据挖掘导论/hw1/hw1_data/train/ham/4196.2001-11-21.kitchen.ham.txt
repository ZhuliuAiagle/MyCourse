( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
houston ( afx ) - enron corp said its creditor banks have granted an extension on a 690 mln usd note payable by nov 27 until mid - december , giving it enough time to restructure the debt .

" we have been in continuous contact with our banks and believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to enhance our cash position , strengthen our balance sheet and address upcoming maturities , " said chief financial officer jeffrey mcmahon .
enron first informed investors of the possibility it would be forced to repay the 690 mln usd note in a filing to the securities and exchange commission on monday .
the obligation arose after standard & poor ' s cut the company ' s long - term debt rating to bbb - last week , forcing it to either post collateral on the note or repay it on maturity .
enron said it has also secured the remaining 450 mln usd of a previously announced 1 bln usd credit line from jp morgan and salomon smith barney . the facility is secured by the assets of enron ' s northern natural gas co unit .
the other 550 mln usd are secured by the assets of its transwestern pipeline co .
enron also said it is still committed to its merger with dynegy inc , announced on nov 9 .
" we continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders , employees , and lenders , " said chairman and chief executive kenneth lay . " it offers the opportunity to create a formidable player in the merchant energy business with substantial growth prospects and a strong financial position . "
jp morgan chase vice chairman james lee said the bank will work with enron and its other creditor banks " to develop a plan to strengthen enron ' s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy " , which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2002 .

houston ( ap ) - shares of embattled enron corp . plunged another 32 percent wednesday morning as analysts and investors continued to doubt the once - mighty energy trader ' s ability to recover lost business and investor confidence .
in a report released wednesday , goldman sachs & co . analyst david fleischer became the latest to question enron ' s future , saying that an sec filing by the houston - based company earlier this week " raised new issues about liquidity and the ability of the company to even finance itself over the next several months . "
analysts are also questioning whether dynegy inc . ' s planned dlrs 8 . 9 billion acquisition of enron will survive given the latest revelations .
documents filed with the securities and exchange commission by enron late monday restated the company ' s third - quarter earnings and stated that it may have to repay a dlrs 690 million debt by next week because of decreased credit ratings .
the filing also noted that enron ' s financial woes have led to a " reduced level of transaction activity " with the company by trading partners .
enron shares fell 23 percent tuesday , then dropped another dlrs 2 . 25 , or 32 percent , to dlrs 4 . 74 wednesday in extremely heavy trading on the new york stock exchange .
fleischer said enron ' s nov . 16 cash balance of dlrs 1 . 2 billion is inadequate to meet remaining debt obligations .
fleischer acknowledged , however , enron ' s efforts to renegotiate next week ' s due date for the dlrs 690 million debt , which was triggered nov . 12 when the company ' s credit rating was downgraded to bbb - , saying that there are indications that enron ' s banks may be willing to roll current maturities over and even make new equity investments .
michelle foss , director of the energy institute at the university of houston , said this latest round of troubles had to raise concerns about whether the dynegy - enron deal will be pulled off .
" it doesn ' t look like it ' s going to be able to happen , " foss said . " it did look like a decent idea when they proposed the merger , but today i ' m sure they ' ll look at it and see if they can salvage their attempt to buy enron . "
shares of dynegy were off dlrs 2 . 55 to dlrs 39 . 15 in trading on the nyse .

tobacco suits by venezuela , brazil ' s espirito santo dropped
miami ( ap ) - health care cost - recovery lawsuits against major u . s . cigarette makers by venezuela and the brazilian state of espirito santo have been dismissed .
" this is another important reminder to american plaintiffs ' lawyers that a state court won ' t ignore the overwhelming number of decisions by federal courts rejecting these lawsuits , " william s . ohlemeyer , philip morris cos . vice president , said tuesday after the decisions .
attorneys for several foreign governments have filed an assortment of lawsuits in u . s . federal and state courts in an attempt to find some legal mechanism that withstands judicial scrutiny .
russia and other brazilian states are among the foreign governments that have sued in miami , where a verdict of dlrs 145 billion was awarded to florida smokers against the five biggest u . s . cigarette makers .
ecuador ' s suit in miami was withdrawn earlier when another state judge announced his intention to dismiss it .

houston , nov . 21 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , whose shares had
dropped 92 percent this year amid a financial crisis , said lenders
extended to mid - december the payment date on a $ 690 million note
due next week .
enron , which agreed to be bought out by rival energy trader
dynegy inc . in a transaction now valued at more than $ 23 billion ,
said earlier this week a drop in its credit rating may force it to
repay the $ 690 million note . the repayment would strain cash
reserves enron needs to back its trading operations , investors and
analysts said .
the houston - based company didn ' t say in its release who holds
the note , which is owed by an affiliated partnership that owns
brazilian natural - gas assets and was backed by enron .
the note is held by a group of banks led by the citibank unit
of citigroup inc . , standard & poor ' s said in a press release
yesterday .
enron also is in discussions with other lenders on a
restructuring of its debt , the company said in a statement
distributed by pr newswire .

lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort , ' ' james lee ,
vice president of jp morgan chase & co . , said in the enron
statement . ` ` we will work with enron and its other primary lenders
to develop a plan to strengthen enron ' s financial position up to
and through its merger with dynegy . ' ' morgan has been advising
enron on its merger with dynegy .
enron said yesterday it may have to pay $ 9 . 15 billion in debt
due by 2003 , suggesting the company may run out of cash before the
merger closes . dynegy has said the merger should close before the
end of the third quarter of 2002 .
enron said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $ 2
billion in cash or credit lines .
shares of enron , the most active stock in u . s . trading , fell
$ 1 . 79 , or 23 percent , to $ 5 . 20 in midday trading . before the
announcement that it had renegotiated the $ 690 million note , its
shares had fallen as much as 42 . 78 percent , the lowest level in
more than a decade .
dynegy fell $ 2 . 50 , or 6 percent , to $ 39 . 20 . shares of
chevrontexaco corp . , which owns 26 percent of dynegy , rose 49

percent notes maturing in july 2006 were bid at 62 cents and
offered at 66 cents , traders said . they sold at about 72 cents
yesterday .
institutional investors sold shares of both companies after
goldman , sachs & co . analyst david fleischer downgraded them to
` ` market perform ' ' from his ` ` recommend ' ' list , other analysts
said .
the dynegy bid ` ` did not eliminate customer concerns about
enron ' s liquidity and long - term viability , ' ' goldman sachs said
in its report . ` ` we now believe that it will be difficult for
enron shares to generate strong returns until it is clear that
enron can operate on a normal basis without having to provide
cash or letters of credit to back routine transactions . ' '
fleischer also cut his 2002 profit estimate for enron to 50
cents from $ 1 . 35 . enron had been expected to make $ 1 . 90 next
year , the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by thomson
financial / first call .

due by 2003 , suggesting the houston - based energy trader may run
out of cash . the company said in a regulatory filing it has less
than $ 2 billion in cash or credit lines .
it also surprised some investors by saying a drop in its
credit rating may force it to repay a $ 690 million note next
week . enron said yesterday the terms of the notes , which it
guaranteed for an affiliated partnership that owns brazilian
natural - gas assets , are being renegotiated and that it had a
` ` verbal indications ' ' that the maturity of the notes will be
extended .
the company ' s dealings with affiliated partnerships led to
earnings restatements , credit - rating cuts , a federal
investigation and a management shakeup . dynegy plans to complete
its buyout by october , and enron may have to ask lenders to
restructure payment schedules .
mirant corp . , aquila inc . and other big energy traders are
doing fewer transactions with enron as concerns increase about
its credit rating and ability to finance daily business ,
executives said yesterday .

plunge says end is near at enron

enron ( ene : nyse - news - commentary - research - analysis ) shares plunged a second straight day wednesday as fear mounted that the struggling energy trader ' s bailout merger plan will unravel .
a potentially lethal cash crunch appears to be gripping enron , even though its planned acquirer dynegy ( dyn : nyse - news - commentary - research - analysis ) has injected $ 1 . 5 billion of cash , and banks have opened new credit lines . an enron collapse would cause weeks of dislocation in the energy markets that would damage other energy traders , and it would cause big losses for the houston company ' s creditors .
just before noon est , enron announced in a press release that it had extended to mid - december a $ 690 million obligation that was due next week . it also said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining $ 450 million of a previously announced $ 1 billion secured credit line that has j . p . morgan chase as its lead banker .
investors have been fleeing enron since the company last month disclosed a $ 1 . 2 billion writedown to unwind some related - party hedging transactions . the securities and exchange commission is probing enron deals with related parties . the october disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested the company hadn ' t been forthcoming about the true state of its finances , and it showed that enron was facing serious liquidity problems .
those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when enron agreed to be acquired by smaller rival dynegy . but enron ' s disclosure monday that it faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the exits . in the wednesday release , enron ceo ken lay said his company was still committed to the merger : " we continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders , employees and lenders . " dynegy later issued a press release indicating it is " continuing our confirmatory due diligence " regarding the merger . neither enron nor dynegy returned calls seeking comment .
after plunging 23 % tuesday to $ 6 . 99 , enron was down a staggering 34 % at one point wednesday . it moved slightly higher after the midday press release to trade at $ 4 . 90 . enron shares have lost more than 80 % of their value since the company issued its third - quarter earnings release last month . dynegy dropped $ 2 . 44 , to $ 39 . 26 , though it remains substantially above premerger levels .
at the heart of enron ' s trouble is the sense that the company isn ' t letting on the full extent of its troubles . the selloff in enron shares began in earnest oct . 16 , when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call that it would take a $ 1 . 2 billion writedown to unwind some related - party transactions . critics of the company said those deals , in which the company did business with separate entities involving enron managers , raised serious ethical and disclosure issues .
the dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for enron , since as a big trading partner dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of enron ' s situation . as a result , shares in both companies rallied after the deal ' s announcement . but monday ' s disclosure that enron faced $ 690 million in bond payments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges than it has detailed . according to a merrill lynch report cited in the new york times wednesday , dynegy wasn ' t aware of the $ 690 million obligation . critics of the deal wondered whether enron had told dynegy about all its obligations .
liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a filing of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as $ 5 billion of cash in recent weeks . by the end of 2002 , enron has to find around $ 9 billion to pay back various obligations . it had $ 1 . 2 billion in cash on hand as of nov . 16 , according to the filing .
tellingly , dynegy shares haven ' t plunged along with enron , suggesting that investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for enron but not for dynegy . at current levels , enron shares are trading at more than a 50 % discount to the dynegy offer .
j . p . morgan has taken a leading role in helping enron . it has lent funds and it helped restructure the $ 690 million obligation . the bank ' s stock was down 78 cents to $ 38 . 62 . " we will work with enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen enron ' s financial position up to and through its merger with dynegy , " said james lee , a top banker at morgan , in the enron release .

dynegy , enron say merger to proceed
by myra p . saefong
1 : 52 pm et nov 21 , 2001
washington ( cbs . mw ) - - merger partners enron and dynegy restated their
commitment wednesday to completing a deal , on the heels of embattled
enron ' s announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to pay
off a $ 690 million note set to come due next week .
" we are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to
accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger , "
said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , in a
statement .
shares of enron ( ene ) recovered slightly in afternoon trading but
remained under pressure .
on heavy volume , the stock - - which had touched $ 4 earlier in the
session - - was down $ 1 . 83 to trade at $ 5 . 16 , a new 10 - year low . some 84
million shares had changed hands .
enron declined 23 percent tuesday after the company revealed the
upcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings .
meanwhile , dynegy shares lost $ 1 . 83 to stand at $ 39 . 87 .
enron said that the lead bank on the $ 690 million debt agreed to extend
the maturity date to mid - december , which will give the company time to
restructure the facility , and added it expects to further restructure
its debt .
" we . . . believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring to
enhance our cash position , strengthen our balance sheet , and address
upcoming maturities , " said jeff mcmahon , chief financial officer , in a
statement .
j . p . morgan chase co . said it and other lenders are committed to
helping enron improve its financial position .
also , enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with dynegy and said
it closed on a previously announced $ 450 million line of credit from
j . p . morgan , collateralized by the company ' s northern natural gas co .
enron - - which is being acquired by its smaller rival dynegy ( dyn ) at a
fire - sale price - - revealed in a securities and exchange commission
filing monday that it had to pay off or refinance $ 690 million in debt
obligations by next monday or risk triggering nearly $ 4 billion in
additional payments .
if enron had missed that deadline and didn ' t post collateral , investors
had the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one of
enron ' s limited partnerships , the unusual business entities at the
center of the company ' s murky transactions currently under
investigation .
the sec filing of monday also contained yet another restatement of
financial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed more
than four years of restated earnings figures .
earlier wednesday , goldman sachs lowered its rating on enron ' s stock to
" market performer " from its " u . s . recommended list , " citing " major "
liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover the
business it has lost .
cibc world markets also cut enron to a " hold " from a " buy . "
commerzbank weighed in wednesday , saying enron ' s viability is in doubt .
" we believe the filing clearly shows that enron remains in a precarious
financial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt , "
analysts andre meade and andrew smith wrote . " it appears that enron ' s
situation could worsen in a number of ways . "
though enron ' s most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscal
situation , meade and smith characterized the information as " piecemeal . "
" it appears that the full extent of enron ' s problems is not currently
known , " they said in a note , cautioning clients against investing in
enron .
