stinson ,

i ' m arriving at the george bush airport in houston next thursday at 5 : 15 pm .
i could then take a taxi to the hotel or the restaurant . how long would it
take me to get there ? is there a " rush hour " problem at that time ?

i ' m flying out of houston on friday at 6 : 45 pm . is there a rush hour problem
on the freeways at that time ? what time should i leave from enron to be at the
airport at 6 pm ?

i hope i ' ll have opportunities to give talks at enron in subsequent visits
along the research path . in this first visit i was hoping to understand better
the research goals of enron and brainstorm with people about what are the
top challenges and opportunities for our research collaboration . identifying
the best research problems in terms of
1 ) highest innovation potential and
2 ) highest projected impact
would be at the top of my list . it might be unprofessional on my side to
talk to an audience that i don ' t have any prior information about and is
very diverse anyway ; it could actually be " dangerous . " i would feel much more
comfortable to do that in my second visit , after i have understood the
environment
better and i have some results to talk about . i would like to be in a
position to " impress " people when i give my first talk at enron . ( besides ,
i will have to prepare good slides for such a talk and i am totally swamped
all next week . )

i ' m swamped , but i ' ll try to put something together .
i look forward to seeing you next week .
