that is great news . we are still pressing the lawyers to see if the enron rep letter can be signed today or in the near future . that way we can issue under the wlb committed lc line .
hopefully once the bank meeting concludes on friday , some of these guys may be more amenable to us using some of the uncommitted lc capacity we have unused at this time .
cheers ,
jr

all ,
barclays has agreed to accept cash collateral on an ongoing basis until such time we are able to post an l / c subject to the provisions stated below .
under the circumstances , i think that they have been very flexible and would be unlikely to negotiate on most of the points . we would need some clarification on point 1 ( onerous if it applies to all contracts under the current isda ) , we would expect 1 . to only apply to so 2 transactions ( written into the so 2 confirm ) .
vincent , brent , i would be grateful if you would take at a look at these points . our timeline is to get everything signed by lpm today .
regards
soma
