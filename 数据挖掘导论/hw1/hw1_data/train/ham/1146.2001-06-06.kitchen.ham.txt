mou has its day

house energy relief efforts
the house energy and commerce committee gave up plans to ease california ' s energy woes because republicans and democrats could not settle a long standing debate over price caps in the west . representative waxman admitted a compromise was never more than a noble idea throughout the debates , and several delayed mark - up sessions for the bill . barton noted the bill had little chance of aid california considering the time it would take to pass the bill would be longer than the california summer .
