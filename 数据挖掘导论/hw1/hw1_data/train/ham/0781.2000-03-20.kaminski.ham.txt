Subject: re : many
hello helyette ,
i am in california this week , vacationing with my family . it is a spring
break week at stanford and we shall spend a few days in calistoga , north of
napa valley , a place famous for mineral water and geysers .
i shall talk to karla when i come back to houston about the speeding up the
process on our side . our lawyers typically sit on a contract for a few weeks
unless we put a lot of pressure on them . american lawyers tend to be very
meticulous : this is why the city of los angeles alone has more lawyers than
entire japan . i think about two sites for your software : houston and europe
( most likely london ) .
i shall be honored to chair a session during the bachelier world congress at
college de france . please , let me know which session you have in mind for me .
the repeat the francfort presentation in paris on october 4 & 5 is fine with
me . i think the frankfurt presentation went quite well and it will be nice to
work wih you and alex again .
regards
vince
p . s . i shall keep my office cell phone on all the time , in case you need to
call me : 713 410 5396
