dear ms . kaminsky :

summer price volatility course , january 30 - february 1 , 2001 in houston .
the course will focus on the various tools at hand to manage summer price
and load volatility . our target audience for this event will primarily be
risk managers and managers in bulk power sales & purchase ( our secondary
target audience is energy traders ) .
attached you will find a draft program agenda for your review . please let
me know if you or someone else at enron is interested in presenting at this
event . in particular , we are looking for someone to talk about weather
derivatives .
i appreciate you taking the time to review the conference schedule and i
hope that i will have an opportunity to talk to you . unfortunately , i am
running behind schedule in finalizing this program . i will call tomorrow to
see what your feedback is . if you have any questions or suggestions , please
