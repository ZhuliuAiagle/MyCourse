subject : thursday hearing
per sandy , it sounds like there is going to be a budget committee hearing on thursday to discuss dwr procurement and the effect of marketers returning customers to utility service . it looks like we may be asked to provide testimony ( but not about any customer specific issues ) . mike day would be the right person to provide that testimony if needed . i ' ll pass on any more details as i get them . mds
