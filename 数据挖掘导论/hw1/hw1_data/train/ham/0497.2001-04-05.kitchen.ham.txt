Subject: re : project vitro review meeting
max :
i have attached a " technical risk template " that should serve as an outline for the presentation . you may also want to discuss some of the major commercial terms and conditions that are driving schedule , performance , and cost .
you don ' t need to address each technical risk item in infinite detail , but we should focus on the key items of scope definition , construction execution , and contractor analysis that can impact value . the objective is to identify what we need to pay attention to as we begin to ramp up the capital expenditure . defining and managing construction risk has become a popular topic given the status of the dabhol and cuiba projects .
we also need to take some time to discuss / settle the outstanding ee & cc invoice ( now eeos ) . i would like to agree a payment number and move on down the road with eeos . the system we have going forward should ensure that no eeos costs are incurred / transferred to the ea origination group until you and the tech services representative have pre - approved them
regards ,
brian
