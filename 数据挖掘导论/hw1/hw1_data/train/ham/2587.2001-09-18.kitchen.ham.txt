ben - per our discussion yesterday , the following changes have been made to the august asset list that is presented to louise :
austin - $ 0
e - next fees - $ 0 ( off - balance sheet ) since this is being accrued for monthly , we decided not to show it at all to avoid confusion .
ft pierce - mhi turbine not shown on ena list - ( off - balance sheet )
please call me with any questions .
thanks !
