subject : power flow software question
walter coffer contacted me regarding whether we still have power flow
software available . we do have almost all of a 200 execution - hour license
for pss / e , which was purchased for the transmission congestion project last
summer . this was purchased by east power trading . should walter want to use
the remaining hours , who has authority to grant this ?
thanks ,
martin
