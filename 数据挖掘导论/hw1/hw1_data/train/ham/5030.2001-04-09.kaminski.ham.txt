dear vince ,
a friend of mine , head of research and new projects in a major bank ,
wanted to get in touch with the energy industry to possibly develop
working relationships . i said that enron was the right place to start
and " you " the right person to meet . in this order , he would come to
the power 2001 and i would introduce him to you .
is this o . k with you ?
best regards
helyette
