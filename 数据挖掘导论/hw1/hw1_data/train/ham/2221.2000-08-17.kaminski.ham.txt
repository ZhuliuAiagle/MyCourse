Subject: re : full version
i read the chapter . generally ,
i like it , and find it non - controversial
and well written . of course , this is
a huge topic and there are things
that you haven ' t discussed .
i thought the amount of attention
paid to ols and mle estimation
was a bit overboard , given that you
didn ' t really exploit it in your
results . if you were to state
the likelihood function for
the garch model , it might justify
the amount of attention to
gave to estimation for
simple iid processes , which could then
be thought of as a simple lead - in
and intuition builder to
the more interesting models that
you do actually use .
by the way , in your discussion of
smiles , you discuss fat tails
extensively . at least for equity markets ,
while fat tails contribute , they don ' t do very
much at all compared to the effect
of risk premia , which you allude to briefly ,
using supply - demand language , at the
end of that section .
for the impact of risk premia , see
jun pan ' s paper , which is available
from her web page . but she covers
only sp 500 , ( as do most studies ) ,
and your markets are obviously much different .
the chapter will be a good service to your readers !
