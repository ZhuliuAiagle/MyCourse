Subject: re : have we totally lost the plot ?
my two cents . . . .
i viewed the goal of the management committee as three - fold
1 . measure management skill
2 . ensure people with superior mgmt skills are appropriately recognized .
3 . ensure best talent ( however defined ) are retained and have mgmt skills nurtured .
to expand on ( 1 ) , ask the questions :
( a ) what attributes characterize a good manager ? from louise ' s list , i would vote for internal alliances and experience .
( b ) how can these be quantified , if at all ?
to expand on ( 2 ) , identify promotion / other opportunities for such people .
the last powerpoint slide is complementing all the discussions so far , but definite goals for the committee were not clear to me - - - do we need to expand on the points on the slide ( i . e . why enron is ahead of other companies , etc . ) ? will we now focus on meritocracy in general and not so much on management itself ?
thanks ,
vasant

subject : have we totally lost the plot ?
jean and i have had a little meeting following a rather interesting 10 minute conversation i had with senior management in enron . suffice to say we have gone in a different direction and thought that we would float out the following concept for you and then we can get together to discuss next week . the work we did in out last meeting is still live .
essentially we are homing in on the one issue of meritocracy and hoping that we are able to make an impact on the organization in relation to this issue .
let ' s discuss next week .
