subject : cost sharing of subscription to poten ' s fuel oil report
all :
ideally we will split this cost evenly among as many p & l ' s as need the
report , minimizing everyone ' s cost by sharing a single subscription .
please tell me whether you can justify sharing the cost and if so , the rc
code & co # for me to allocate your cost share . please indicate your choice
of the three cost choices .
attached note below clarifies poten ' s proposal on the $ 10 , 000 / yr subscription .
essentially we have three choices :
1 . for $ 2700 / yr , the standard edition ( 11 issues , excluding the monthly
" special feature " article )
2 . for $ 3800 / yr the premium edition , ( standard edition plus the monthly
" special feature " article , as in three attached examples )
3 . for $ 10 , 000 / yr the premium edition plus quarterly forward price view for
36 months .
poten explains that 85 % of their subscribers take the premium service . no
one has ever asked for the $ 10 , 000 / yr long - term price forecast . i have an
interest in a longer term price forecast and hope that it may be useful to
others in the corporation .
the example copies attached include the following special feature articles :
99 feb - analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean
99 sep - patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere
99 dec - analysis of the resid market in chile
one either takes all or none of them for the incremental $ 1100 / yr . some may
be useless , others perhaps quite valuable . your call .

niamh & doug & margaret :
i want to chat about this and will call you , but the essence is :
can you justify sharing the cost of subscribing to poten ' s monthly fuel oil
report ?
attached below are 3 example copies that include their standard 12 month
price forecasts . the cost is $ 3800 / yr .
as an added service for a total of $ 10 , 000 / yr , poten will include a quarterly
update of their 36 month forward view on crude oil and fo prices with a brief
justification for their view . this would include the standard monthly price
forecast for the prompt 12 months and quarterly prices for the following 24
months for far east , med and nwe . ( i expect a more descriptive email from
poten , but i think this is the essence of their " custom " offer . )
the example copies attached include the following special features :
99 feb - analysis of resid trades in the eastern mediterranean
99 sep - patterns of fuel oil trade in the western hemisphere
99 dec - analysis of the resid market in chile
these type of features are produced monthly and run a spectrum of subjects
related to fuel oil .
i have a hard time justifying the cost of the newsletter and the price
forecast without the considered recommendation of colleagues such as yourself
regarding the utility of such a report . the best way to show your
recommendation is with money . if it is not worth any money to anyone else in
ene , then i have to question its validity and utility to me as well . doug ,
would this perhaps be useful to any other business units that have exposure
to fo prices ?
best regards
guy
