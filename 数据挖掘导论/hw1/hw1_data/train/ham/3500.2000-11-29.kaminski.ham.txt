Subject: re : enron tiger dinner
donna ,
thanks for the restaurant recommendation . i would appreciate if you could
coordinate
the dinner with the students and the faculty . you can expect 4 persons from
enron but the
restaurant should allow for some flexibility , just in case . if the restaurant
needs a credit card number
or a security deposit , you can refer them to my assistant , shirley crenshaw
at 713 853 5290 .

i look forward to seeing you and jeff shankman next week in regard to the
enron tiger kick - off meeting scheduled for wednesday , dec 6 in vance hall
210 from 3 : 00 - 5 : 00 pm .
you mentioned possibly wanting to take the group to dinner after the
presentation . i would like to recommend the palladium restaurnat , which is
on locust walk here on campus . you may want to view their website at
www . . com i think they have a nice menu and can
accomodate large groups . there are several menus from which to choose , as
well . please let me know if you would like for me to set this up for you
and i will notify the students and faculty .
please let me know if i can assist with your visit in any way .
regards ,
donna piazze
