Subject: abb contract
dave ,
i am still diving into the depths of tex - mex , but cannot see a reason not to proceed with signing the abb amendment as described in salsa ( 4 ) , as this amendment does not cost us anything up front and extends our build option to the end of the year .
there are a number of risks associated with the presidential permit process , the possible imposition of an open season by ferc , relationship with cfe , bpub infrastructure enhancements and service charge structure , etc . which we should discuss prior to waiving our conditions precedent under the deacero contract on july 31 .
note that if we sign the abb amendment and waive the conditions precedent along with deacero on july 31 , we will want to immediately issue a pre - notice of the notice to proceed in order to ensure completion within the 502 day deacero commitment .
