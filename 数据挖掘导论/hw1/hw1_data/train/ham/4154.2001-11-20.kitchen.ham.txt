Subject: re : what ' s in rawhide - urgent
i ' m not familiar with the individual assets ( might include gaspart and ceg / rio ) of that structure but the critical asset apparently is a $ 690 mm loan to enron . when enron hit bbb - rating , rawhide was no longer allowed to lend to enron and called the note due . there was a rawhide bankers meeting late yesterday to consider enron ' s request to delay the call by several weeks . neither bowen nor myself know if any decision has been reached by the lenders at this time .
