breaking news ! !
may 18 - - nomad international inc . ( ndin ) commented today on the recent
announcement by the canadian radio - teievision and teiecommunications
commission ( crtc ) that they would reguiate voice over internet protoco |
( voip ) service only when it is provided and used as loca | telephone
service .
in its decision , the crtc determined that in an effort to buiid
sustainabie competition in | ocal telephone markets , the incumbent carriers
wil | not be permitted to price their | ocal voip services below cost to
stifie competition .
" the ruling is a very positive one for nomad in our efforts to enter
the canadian market with our products via internet service providers ,
cabie companies and virtual operators . the ruiing permits us to enter the
market with a competitive framework , " stated jan oliver , ceo of nomad
international inc .
the key to nomad ' s entry into the voip market is the abiiity of its
products to offer services to both broadband and dia | - up customers . though
broadband is gaining more and more acceptance and utilization
worldwide , dia | - up remains the primary source of internet connectivity . in the
u . s . alone , there are over 2 oo , 0 oo , 000 users of the internet . of the
total users in the u . s . , the tota | number of users of broadband is only
approximateiy 40 , ooo , ooo ; ( stats by the yankee group ) dial - up therefore
represents approximateiy 80 % of the entire internet connectivity market .
the percentage of dial - up versus broadband users worldwide is even
higher .
nomad ' s abiiity to offer voip products to dial - up customers and service
providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration ,
but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace
by offering a unique , proprietary and easily adaptable product .
