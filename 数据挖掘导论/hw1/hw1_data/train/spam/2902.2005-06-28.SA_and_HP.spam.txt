conference overview
cisse 05 provides a virtual forum for presentation and discussion of the
state - of the - art research on computers , information and systems sciences and
engineering . the virtual conference will be conducted through the internet
using web - conferencing tools , made available by the conference .
authors will be presenting their powerpoint , audio or video presentations
using web - conferencing tools without the need for travel . conference
sessions will be broadcast to all the conference participants , where session
participants can interact with the presenter during the presentation and
( or ) during the q & a slot that follows the presentation .
this international conference will be held entirely on - line . the accepted and
presented papers will be made available after the conference both on a cd and
as a book publication .
conference participants - authors , presenters and attendees - only need an
internet connection and sound available on their computers in order to be
able to contribute and participate in this international ground - breaking
conference .
the on - line structure of this high - quality event will allow academic
professionals and industry participants to contribute work and attend
world - class technical presentations based on rigorously refereed
submissions , live , without the need for investing significant travel funds
or time out of the office .
potential non - author conference attendees who cannot make the on - line
conference dates are encouraged to register , as the entire joint conferences
will be archived for future viewing .
