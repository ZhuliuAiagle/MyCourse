Subject: selling travel in today ' s economy
good morning !
since it may have been awhile since you visited us
atwww . mailpound . comi
wanted to update you on what is happening . when we launched the mailpound
almost two years ago , our focus was on saving time , toner and
treesby providing an alternative fororganizing the huge
number of faxes suppliers sent travel agents each week . our most popular
feature was the fam section , followed by the weekly sweepstakes .
but that has changed .
like many involved in selling retail travel , we have been
striving to find ways to succeed in a challenging environment . additional
commission cuts , the aftermath of 9 / 11 , and the drop in the stock
market , has
had a cumulative effect on all of us . to survive , to succeed , we know
that we
will need to work harder , work smarter , and work together . we have
gotten a
tremendous amount of support from travel agents and this has translated
into
the ability to get more support for travel agents from suppliers .
our focus has expanded from providing a resource for
searching supplier
special offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create
sales and raise commissions . almost all of these services are supplier
supported and free to travel agents .
