Subject: [ ilug ] do not drop your life insurance
dear ilug @ linux . ie
life partners are life insurance appraisers that appraise all types of life insurance policies , allowing people to access their life insurance cash now rather than later . we help individuals unlock cash from unutilized assets .
individuals usually age 65 or older who find that their health , financial and / or estate planning needs have changed are typical candidates . we have had some candidates advised by financial planners to drop their life insurance policies so they could invest their money in a vehicle that will make them a return now . do not drop your policy as it may be worth cash to you now .
why do people sell their policies ?
the reasons individuals make the decision to sell their life insurance policies are as varied as the people themselves . some reasons may be to :
pay off debts
fund long term care insurance cost
eliminate costly premiums
take advantage of other financial opportunities
make charitable contributions
help family members
