Subject: from oliver please reply
dear friend ,
i can ' t imagine how you will feel receiving a sudden business letter from
a remote country in far away west africa and probably from some one you
have not closely related with . but all the same , i believe we do not need
to be of blood relatives before we can establish cordial / business relationship .
having said this , i think it is very important at this juncture to introduce
myself to you and also disclose to you , how i came in contact with your
email address . my name is justice oliver , i work with one of the finance
and security companies here in cotonou - republic of
benin . i got your contact when i was searching the internet for the family
tree . . . . . . of our decease customer .
in my department i discover abandon fund deposit by the decease customer
who die some years back and left no one to claim this fund . however , since
i got information about his death , i have made several enquiries to your
embassy to locate any of his extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful
after several attempts hence i decided to contact you direct based on this
deal which is highly confidential and i believing that you will be capable
of executing this transaction with me .
my dear friend , the deal here is that the money will be approved and remitted
to you as the relation to the decease provided i will give you correct information
to the deposit , i have such needed information and will hand it over to
you as soon as we commence the transaction before it declared unserviceable
.
i am contacting you because it is very difficult for me to lay hands on
this fund coupled with the fact that the beneficiary was a foreigner from
your country and cannot transact the business with anybody who is known
to any staff of this institution or anybody around here to avoid jeopardize
at the end of the transaction .
therefore , to enable the immediate release of this fund to your position
i will need your to give me an addresses which i can use to do the underground
work and forward the application text to you for direct submission to the
institution to enable transferring the credit balance of the said deposit
to your nominated bank account in overseas , on this ground i request your
unreserved but sincere cooperation devoid of greed in carrying out this
transaction to avoid jeopardize or leakage . i am prepared to
split at 60 % / 40 % for you , provided that mine ( 60 % ) will be intact at the
end . if the contents dose not meet with your personal and business ethics
i apologise in advance , be assured that this will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect us from any breach of the law , upon your acceptance
i will clarify you more about this deal and the total amount involved .
be warned not to reveal this deal to any third party to avoid jeopardize
this transaction and my position in this office , please treat this matter
as urgent as possible . kindly contact me only on my alternative email as
a matter of urgency through this email justiceoliver 75 @ jippii . fi i will
