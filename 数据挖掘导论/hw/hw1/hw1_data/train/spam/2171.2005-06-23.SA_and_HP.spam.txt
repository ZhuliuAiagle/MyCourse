overview
global diversified industries operates in the modular
building construction industry , and strategically targets the
california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in
central
california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art
manufacturing facility .
throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building
its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a
state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the
requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth .
through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million
capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state
of
california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to
become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the
west coast .
gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion
school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by
california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion
an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before
the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and
subsequently invests in those companies .
global diversified has taken numerous strategic
development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating
strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive
growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with
previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum
businesses .
in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue
projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state
approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit
facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing
facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition
candidates through its aggressive growth plan .
profile
gdvi is a holding company that currently
operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a
modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work
and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and
manufacturing of modular type structures .
its principal customer base is currently educational
( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and
municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of
portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two -
story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures
are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved
building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications
administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) .
global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing
educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback
clause . the state of
california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular
classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful
bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities
portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the
originating school district . this process saves school districts
valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids .
a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may
have access to future business for up to five years , depending on
the term of the piggyback contract .
the strategic focus on california schools
since 1998 ,
california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new
classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures .
there are five compelling reasons for this trend :
modular
classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks )
they cost
significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 )
they offer
greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings
they are easier
to finance
they provide
financing incentives
to cope with population growth , the state department of
education estimates that
california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the
next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms .
due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout
the california education sector , public and private schools are
expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their
additional classroom requirements over the next four years .
the california schools budget crisis
on
november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond
proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by
california
voters .
this bond measure passage does not include an approximate
$ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school
districts throughout the state .
a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the
voters on the march 2004 .
these bond measures are about three times higher than the
record $ 9 . 2 billion bond
california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these
bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which
include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular
classroom construction and renovations .
money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and
private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at
community colleges and other institutions of higher learning
throughout
california .

state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes
