Subject: your help
dear sir ,
i am mrs mariam abacha , wife of the late nigerian
head of state , general sani abacha who died on
the 8 th
of june 1998 while still on active duty . i am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will
be of
great assistance to each other likewise
developing a
cordial relationship .
i currently have within my reach the sum of
thirty
six million united states dollars
( us $ 36 , 000 , 000 ) in
cash , which i intend to use for investment
purposes
specifically in your country . this money came
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my
late
husband and a russian firm on our country ' s
multi - billion dollars ajaokuta steel plant . the
russian partners returned my husbands share of
us $ 36 , 000 , 000 after his death and lodge it with
my
late husband ' s security company in nigeria of
which i
am a director . right now the new civilian
government
have intensified their probe on my husband ' s
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company .
in view
of this , i acted very fast to withdraw the
us $ 36 , 000 , 000 from the company ' s vault and
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad .
no record ever existed concerning the money
neither is
the money traceable by the government because
there is
no documentation showing that we received the
money
from the russians .
due to the current situation in the country
concerning
government attitude towards my family , it has
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this
money
within , thus i seek assistance to transfer this
money
into your safe bank account . on your consent , i
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction .
bearing in mind that your assistance is needed
to
transfer the funds , i propose a commission of
20 % of
the total sum to you for the expected services
and
assistance . your urgent response is highly
needed so
as to stop further contacts . all correspondent
should be forwarded to this email : zenab . m @ ompadec . zzn . con
or you can call my son mobile : hamza 234 - 8023137978 i use this
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while i
await your
prompt response .
best personal regards ,
mrs mariam abacha .
