i am mr . gary adams , senior
credit officer , barclays bank plc london . i am writing following an
opportunity in my office that will be of immense benefit to both of
us .
in my department we discovered
an abandoned sum of £ 12 . 5 million british pounds sterling ( twelve
million five hundred thousand british pounds sterling ) in an account
that belongs to one of our foreign customers late mr . morris
thompson an american who unfortunately lost his life in the plane
crash of alaska airlines
flight 261 , which crashed on
january 31 2000 , including his wife and only daughter . you shall
read more about the crash on visiting this website .
since we got information about
his death , we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to
come over and claim his money because the bank cannot release the
funds unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to
the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines .
unfortunately i learnt that
his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him
in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this fund
behind for the claim . it is therefore upon this discovery that i and
two other officials in this department now decided to do business
with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or
beneficiary of the funds for safe keeping and subsequent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don ' t want this
money to go back into government treasury as unclaimed bill .
we agreed that 20 % of this
money would be for you as foreign partner , while the balance will be
for my colleagues and i . we will visit your country for the
disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this
money gets into your account . please be honest to me as trust is
our watchword in this transaction .
note that this transaction is
confidential and risk free . as soon as you receive this mail you
should contact me by return mail whether or not you are willing to
enter into this deal . in the event you are not interested , i
sincerely ask that you disregard this email and tell no one about
it . i am very careful on truncating my banking career should you
mention this to someone else . i hope you can be trusted in this
regard .
please note that all necessary
arrangement for the smooth release of these funds to you has been
finalized . we will discuss much in details when i do receive your
response .
please in your response
include your telephone and fax numbers for a better communication
between us .
you can reach me on the email
below
best regards
gary adams
