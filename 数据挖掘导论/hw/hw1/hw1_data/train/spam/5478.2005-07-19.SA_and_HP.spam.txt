the paradox of
stress
there is a level of genius in every human being
and it is called a ' gift ' . stress however plays a huge role in how
we deliver it to the world . the mystery is that stress is a good
thing when used properly and a bad thing when misused . how can
that be ? consider these get me thru points about
stress . i learned about them the hard way . you don ' t have to make my
mistakes .
stress is a process in life and not just a
thing that happens
stress literally enters your being daily and
it must also be shown the exit door daily
stress should be utilized as a tool for
forward movement in the face of challenge
stress keeps you alert at the beginning ,
weighs on you midway and brings you down in the end if you keep it
to long
stress is an excellent motivator but unlike
motivation , it doesn ' t just disappear
a get me thru nugget of wisdom : wherever
you store your stress is where you can expect to experiencethe
most damage , physically , spiritually or financially . . . in the end ,
someoneelse most likely will have to inform you about the
severity of your damage .
a
get me thru question : do you process your stress daily for
authentic success or do you store it daily for
disaster ?
so you see the parameters of
stress will enter the board room or home , it has no preference . -
it ' s all about people and not position . however , when ignored stress
will ultimately determine how far each one of us goes in life -
guaranteed !
read what i learned about how to
process stress and how misusing it nearly cost me my life in chapter
8 of " the voice
of my boundaries " .
the coach ' s play of the
month : " motivation excites
you about someone else ' s answers . inspiration
ignites your inner
strength through questions thatlead you to successful actions
and self - awareness . "
the get me thru question for this
month should last you for a lifetime , because stress is a part of
life forever . whether you want to be a millionaire or merely
survive , you too must make a decision about processing stress . your
success in life demands it !
