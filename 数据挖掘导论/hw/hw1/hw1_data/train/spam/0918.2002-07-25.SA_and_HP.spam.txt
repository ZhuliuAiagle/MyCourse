Subject: you only think you ' re u . s . citizen ! ! 8403 zmsx 2 - 110 - 12
you only think you ' re a
u . s . citizen ! !
if you were born in washington d . c . , puerto rico ,
guam , the virgin islands or some other u . s .
possession ; you ' re right and i ' m wrong .
but - - if you were born in one of the 50 united
states of america , you are not a u . s .
citizen .
rather , you are a citizen of idaho , ohio , maine ,
etc . ; the state of the union in which you were
born !
this simple reality holds serious benefits for you !
since you are not a " federal " citizen , you
owe
no federal income taxes . the irs
can only demand
income tax payments from 3 kinds of citizens :
1 . those who are citizens of the u . s . !
2 . anyone who receives " income " from a u . s .
source
( and wait until you find out what " income " really
is ! ) .
3 . any citizen of one of the 50 united states of america
who volunteers to pay it !
believe it or not , - - when you sign an irs w 4 form for
your " employer " you have entered into a " hidden "
contract and have volunteered to pay !
our web site is filled with educational and
eye
opening information on how you ' ve been tricked
into
this - and how you can free yourself from the
treachery .
