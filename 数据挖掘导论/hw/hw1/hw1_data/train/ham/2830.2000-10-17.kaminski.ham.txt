subject : completion of lng model review
the review of eric groves ' lng model spreadsheet has been completed . no
independent model was available for use in the comparison ; however , the model
appears complete and accurate in representating all important cost and
revenue elements .
if this financial model is coupled with a optimization model for planning
ship usage in the future , additional variables may be needed to represent the
variability of trip times , weather factors , etc . a reference describing
these possible additions was provided .
