Subject: re : originations schedule
dear louise and faith
i had a review of the spreadsheet and noticed an error in allocation of value for the central maine power deal . the $ 5 mm of orig value for this deal was incorrectly allocated to jeff ader . this value should be allocated to myself and george wood ( woody ) , who worked with me on the deal . as for the appropriate split between me and woody , i think dave duran and ed baughman should make the call on that ( i believe both dave and ed are on holiday this week ) .
in addition , i had one other deal that did not make it next to my name . this deal involved selling icap in nepool to new england power company and had orig value of $ 40 , 000 . i am trying to find a deal number for this . as we discussed faith , it is possible that the deal for $ 40 k under jeff ader ' s name is in fact this deal , in which case this value should be reallocated to me .
regards
john

hi louise ,
as requested , attached is a file that contains june ytd originations by originator .
we ' ve arranged the file in the following sorts :
? by team
? by originator ( sorted alphabetically )
? by originator ( sorted by value )
? top 10 overall originators by value
? top 10 originators - gas

an item to note is that not all deals had a related individual ' s name ( such as enduser ) - we left the listing as it appears in the risk book in these cases .
