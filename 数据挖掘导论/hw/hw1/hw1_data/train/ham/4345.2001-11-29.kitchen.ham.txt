london , nov 29 ( reuters ) - the credit derivatives market faced a double threat from troubled u . s . energy trader enron on thursday , leaving dealers divided on whether the rapid growth of the market might be at risk .
enron ' s troubles impact the market through credit derivatives contracts written on the company , which would be triggered if it files for bankruptcy protection , and through deals transacted by its enron credit subsidiary , which specialised in trading credit protection on third parties .
credit derivatives are insurance - like tools that allow investors to hedge or gain the risk of an issuer defaulting on a loan or bond . default swaps , the most liquid type of credit derivative , involve the buyer paying the protection seller an annual premium , measured in basis points .
accountants said they had been appointed administrator to enron ' s european division on thursday . some dealers predicted that if enron goes under , the credit derivative contracts on enron and entered into by enron would be unwound in an orderly way .
" it will be another good example of how the market does work . . . it will regain people ' s confidence in the market , " said guy america , vice president for credit derivatives at j . p . morgan chase in london .
image problem
however , other dealers predicted a messy conclusion .
" the impact is clearly a loss of confidence in the credit derivative market overall , " said a default swaps trader with a european bank .
the most recent corporate failure to trigger a large number of default swaps , that of u . k . rail operator railtrack , resulted in banks calling in lawyers to see if they had to pay out on certain obligations .
dealers said enron was an actively traded name in the default swaps market , mainly in new york . as a privately negotiated market , it is difficult to get accurate figures for the value of contracts outstanding on enron , however , dealers said well over a billion dollars of protection on enron had been written .
" ( it was ) one of the benchmark names for the us credit ( derivative market ) . . . so you can guess that a lot of people were involved in this credit through default swaps , " said the european bank trader .
uncertain credit insurance
potentially more damaging for the credit derivatives market is the failure of enron credit . the subsidiary specialised in selling credit risk mitigation tools to companies who wanted to hedge against customers going bankrupt and failing to pay .
if end - users now find the derivatives they bought no longer give them the level of credit protection they expected , it may make it harder for banks in future to convince more of their customers to start using the tools .
on the back of demand from end - users , enron credit was active in the inter - dealer default swaps market . a filing for bankruptcy by enron corp . could trigger settlement on all the contracts into which enron credit entered .
this would involve a large number of contracts and dealers say this would be concentrated among the limited circle of banks , mainly enron corp . s bank lenders , which accepted enron credit as a dealing counterparty .
" it was not broadly accepted as a counterparty , " said one dealer , who added that he hadn ' t seen the firm in the market since october .
lenders face biggest loss
however , most dealers concur that any losses the banks might incur on credit derivatives contracts would be small compared to potential lending losses .
" counterparty losses would be dwarfed by direct lending exposure , " said the head of credit derivatives at a euroepan bank .
dealers said some banks had looked at taking on the enron credit trading book but that this now looked unlikely .
" the banks that were involved in trying to rescue the bank recently . . were also involved in overlooking their credit book and potentially making a bid to take it into their own book , " said one trader .
shares in enron fell 85 percent to 61 cents after a rescue deal by smaller rival dynegy inc fell apart on wednesday . on thursday the company said it may not pay previously declared dividends .

london , nov 29 ( reuters ) - enron ' s european business said on thursday it has been operating separately from its u . s . parent company since wednesday when headquarters in houston stopped cash tranfers to the european trading business .
accountants in london were appointed administrators on thursday to the european operation of crisis - hit enron .
" effectively london is operating separately . the european operation gets cash from houston to trade - they stopped giving us cash yesterday , " said an enron europe spokesman .
he said the administration order covered mainly the european wholesale trading business which is based in london .
it does not cover seven separate businesses belonging to enron in the uk , including the teesside power station and regional water utility wessex water , as well as enron ' s european assets .

usa : u . s . stocks set to open flat to a little up .

new york , nov 29 ( reuters ) - stocks are set to open flat to slightly higher on thursday following some upbeat corporate outlooks , but mixed economic data and the aftermath of the near - collapse of energy trader enron corp . could affect trading .
enron , teetering on the brink of one of the biggest corporate implosions in u . s . history , plunged 85 percent in frenzied trading wednesday . it dragged on the market as investors also sold amid worry that a rally from sept . 21 lows reached in the wake of the attacks on the united states was overdone .
" the enron collapse may have significant ramifications on banks and other energy companies where contracts with enron may now not be honored . and the enron equity may be worthless , " said alan ackerman , market strategist with brokerage fahnestock & co .
equity index futures were up but at one point off earlier highs after the release of data at 8 . 30 a . m . ( 1330 gmt ) that showed a rise in jobless claims but also a rise in durable goods orders .
" there was a mixed response . we saw an encouraging number in the durable goods but it ' s too early to see this as a sustained trend up and layoffs continue to be a real concern , " ackerman added .
the number of americans lining up for first - time jobless benefits rose by 54 , 000 last week , exceeding wall street expectations and showed continued weakening in the u . s . labor market . the data showed the number of so - called continued claims rose by 301 , 000 to 4 . 02 million for the week ended nov . 17 , the biggest one - week increase in 27 years .
orders for costly u . s . durable goods surged at the fastest rate on record in october by 12 . 8 percent to $ 184 . 8 billion , led by huge increases in orders for aircraft and defense capital goods . the data may help rekindle hopes that the economy has rebounded since the sept . 11 attacks .
equity index futures suggested a largely flat to slightly higher open . december futures for the s & p 500 index rose 1 . 70 points to 1 , 130 . 80 while futures for the nasdaq 100 added 8 points to 1 , 567 . futures for the dow jones industrials gained 7 points at 9 , 720 .
other indicators flagged a mildly higher open . the indicative dow jones industrial average , which is based on prices of dow stocks trading in germany ' s deutsche boerse u . s . market segment , rose 45 . 95 points , or 0 . 47 percent , to 9 , 757 . 81 .
the nasdaq - 100 premarket indicator was up 9 . 2 points , or 0 . 59 percent , based on trading ahead of the open in the tech - heavy index ' s biggest stocks .
hand - held computer maker palm inc . rose in extended - hours trading on wednesday and pre - open trade on thursday after the company said it expects to meet estimates . palm rose to $ 3 . 7 pre - open from its nasdaq close of $ 3 . 41 .
storage networking company brocade communications systems inc . rose to $ 30 . 30 ahead of the open from a close at $ 28 . 82 . the company reported quarterly operating profits fell sharply as the slower economy kept many corporate buyers on the sidelines , although the results beat wall street forecasts .
enron , which finished at 61 cents on wednesday , was a little higher in pre - open trading , at 69 cents . enron sank wednesday after rival dynegy inc . pulled out of its planned $ 9 billion takeover of the beleaguered energy trader . credit rating agencies slashed enron ' s bonds to junk status and shoved the once mighty company another step closer to bankruptcy .
enron squeezed other energy traders and financial giants citigroup inc . and jp morgan chase & co . inc . , which may suffer losses of more than $ 400 million combined on their lending to the energy trading group , according to at least one analyst .
on wednesday , the blue - chip dow jones industrial average surrendered 160 . 74 points , or 1 . 63 percent , to 9 , 711 . 86 , the largest drop in about a month and the lowest close since nov . 12 . the broader standard & poor ' s 500 index slid 20 . 98 points , or 1 . 83 percent , to 1 , 128 . 52 . the technology - laced nasdaq composite index dropped 48 points , or 2 . 48 percent , to 1 , 887 . 97 .
in other pre - open activity , software provider freemarkets inc . rose after raising its quarterly revenue and profit outlook after several large customers renewed long - term contracts . shares rose to $ 16 . 20 from a close of $ 13 . 59 .
h & r block inc . , the no . 1 u . s . tax preparer , rose to $ 37 . 25 on the instinet trading system after closing at $ 36 on the new york stock exchange . the company raised its profit forecasts for the current fiscal year as its second - quarter loss narrowed , helped by new accounting rules and strong mortgage business performance .

uk : enron europe not seen in default on energy trade .

london , nov 29 ( reuters ) - beleaguered u . s . energy trader enron so far has not defaulted on any of its over - the - counter energy swap contracts in europe , dealers said on thursday . but many in the trading community have arranged alternative trades to cover their exposure as news emerged that enron had sought protection from its creditors and appointed accountant as administrator .
enron stands on the brink of bankruptcy after a rescue deal with its smaller rival dynegy fell apart on wednesday . the company halted trading on its enrononline platform on the same day .
" they haven ' t had any defaults yet . but nobody ' s trading with them at the moment , " a dealer at a major oil company which had trading links with enron said .
dealers said enron had been missing from the european oil otc market for over a week and many companies had stopped trading with them a month ago as signs emerged of financial difficulties at america ' s largest energy trader .
in the oil market , enron ' s trading activities extended right across the petroleum product chain as well as various brent crude derivatives contracts .
they said the dated to front line ( dfl ) brent contract , which balances the risk of dated brent against the front - month ipe futures contract , had seen substantial activity on thursday amid speculation that some players had moved to square off their positions against exposures to enron .
" it ' s a case of closing up positions , " a brent trader said .
dealers said enron was believed to have closed positions on london ' s international petroleum exchange . the ipe declined comment .
the dealers said a shortlived price spike late on wednesday on ipe and nymex crude oil and nymex natural gas futures markets suggested a brief session of short covering .
" there was a short spell when the natural gas market was strengthening and wti moved up . one broker was doing most of the buying and most people thought he was covering for enron . but the market came straight back down , " said one futures dealer .
an spokeswoman for the ipe said its compliance department was looking at enron ' s positions on the market and had been talking with financial services authority and clearing house .
" we will be able to maintain the integrity of the market , " the spokeswoman said .

new york - ( dow jones ) - salomon smith barney analyst guy moszkowski said the troubles at enron corp . ( ene ) will not have a material impact on brokerage firms ' credit and counterparty energy trading exposure .
in a research note thursday , moszkowski said the credit exposure to enron among the larger securities firms - morgan stanley ( mwd ) , merrill lynch & co . ( mer ) , goldman sachs group inc . ( gs ) , bear stearns cos . ( bsc ) and lehman brothers holdings inc . ( leh ) - is minimal and is largely hedged where it exists .
among the larger brokers , only morgan stanley and goldman sachs have " meaningful " operations in energy trading , moszkowski said .
" against the backdrop of significantly improved risk management procedures in the industry , we believe exposure to enron has been curtailed for some time now , particularly as concern regarding the firm ' s credit worthiness is hardly a new development , " moszkowski said . " however , given the sophistication and complexity of energy contracts , we believe it is fair to assume there will be some - albeit likely limited and , ultimately , immaterial - counterparty exposure at both goldman sachs and morgan stanley . "

dollar under pressure on u . s . economic woes , enron situation

dow jones newswires
new york - - the dollar was under pressure thursday , weighed down by a combination of the federal reserve ' s somber outlook for the u . s . economy , waning u . s . consumer confidence and concerns about the financial woes of enron corp .
in morning new york trading , the euro was at 89 . 04 u . s . cents , up from 88 . 82 cents late wednesday in new york . the dollar was at 123 . 07 yen , little changed from 123 . 06 yen late wednesday .
the greenback was also at 1 . 6480 swiss francs , compared with 1 . 6465 , while sterling was trading at $ 1 . 4254 , down slightly from $ 1 . 4259 late wednesday .
the dollar managed to get a brief respite from u . s . durable goods data for october , which showed orders for big ticket items sharply rebounded by a record amount , more than reversing september ' s large drop .
but the overall tone for the dollar remains weak , amid a growing sense that the u . s . might not be able to rebound from recession as fast as previously thought .
" the dollar is a little heavy across the board , " said robert sinche , head of global currency strategy at citibank in new york . " unless you get something completely outrageous , it looks likely to remain that way . "
the dollar has fallen below key support levels against both the euro and the yen , as traders moved to liquidate a spate of long dollar positions .
while the enron situation doesn ' t have a direct effect on foreign exchange markets , analysts said that it wasn ' t helping dollar sentiment .
" the market was ripe for an unwinding of long dollar positions , " said mr . sinche . " enron . . . is the kind of situation that just acts as a catalyst . "
as is often the case , the euro ' s gains appeared to be more a result of pessimism towards the u . s . rather than any optimism about the euro zone .
the market largely shrugged off third quarter euro - zone gross domestic product data earlier thursday which came in exactly as expected : up 0 . 1 % on the quarter and 1 . 3 % on the year .
the dollar ' s direction thursday will also be influenced by u . s . shares , with prospects for a marked rebound looking slim in the wake of the enron woes .
analysts said a sustained move above the 89 cent level could set the euro up for a test of 89 . 45 cents and then 90 cents , which is expected to offer more formidable resistance .
its difficulty in making a concerted push for 90 cents is probably down to the potential outflows related to the morgan stanley capital international indexes rebalancing , and the deutsche telekom / voicestream deal .
the first phase of the new msci weightings comes into effect friday , and should involve fund managers reducing their exposure to euro zone equities .
so far , this seems to have been discounted , although it could still help to keep a lid on the euro .
the lockup period for voicestream shareholders to keep hold of their deutsche telekom shares expires dec . 1 , which could prompt them to offload the stock , in effect resulting in sizable euro - zone outflows .
benign inflation data from switzerland out earlier thursday - up only 0 . 3 % in november on the year - has paved the way for the swiss national bank to cut interest rates at its next meeting dec . 7 .

charlotte , n . c . , nov . 29 / prnewswire / - - duke energy ( nyse : duk ) today expressed confidence in the vitality of the energy sector and said it had taken steps to manage its exposure during the very serious difficulties being experienced by enron , including instituting a trading halt .
" although we didn ' t completely cease trading with enron until yesterday , in the course of our normal credit practices , we took steps to limit our exposure to enron . we currently have approximately $ 100 million in non - collaterized exposure to enron . we are closely monitoring this unfortunate situation to determine if a provision against earnings is appropriate , " said richard j . osborne , executive vice president and chief risk officer for duke energy .

the company remains fully committed to deliver earnings growth within its stated guidance of 10 percent to 15 percent compound annual growth in earnings per share from a base of $ 2 . 10 in 2000 . based on the strong results reported for the first three quarters of this year , duke energy had previously communicated it will likely exceed 15 percent earnings growth in 2001 . yesterday ' s developments do not change that view .
