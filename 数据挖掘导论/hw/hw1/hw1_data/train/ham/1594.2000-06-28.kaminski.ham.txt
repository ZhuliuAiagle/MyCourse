Subject: re : chapter 3
gentlemen ,
thankyou for your fine effort . i ' ll e - mail thru thurs eve ( sydney time ) what
we have done to incorporate it into our material ( which wasn ' t toooo
painful ) to see if it is ok with you . a couple of quick questions though .
vince - your section had a number of footnote numbers , but no actual
footnotes - can you please resend them ?
grant - i agree it would be good to have the final figure . what happens if
you plot the historical data and the simulations on the same graph - but
with different axis ?
many thanks and best regards .
chris .
