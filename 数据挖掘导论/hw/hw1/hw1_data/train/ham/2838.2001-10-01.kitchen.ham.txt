Subject: re : ibuyit weekly activity report
louise ,
sorry for the confusion . attached is revised look at this report . you can now see the approver for each shopping basket created ( note : if approver is blank , the requistioner had authority to approve themselves ) . i have also opened the columns which show the shopping cart line item descriptions and amount . the shopping cart column was showing you the total of the shopping cart with each item in the basket which really is not very helpful . ( i . e . , 3 items ordered for $ 100 , $ 200 and $ 300 respectively all in one shopping basket with the report showing that the shopping basket was $ 600 ) .
thanks
john

i am a bit confused i thought we had agreed to the following last week .
expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved .
issues :
why are there so many repeat lines , each request is issuing 3 times in some cases . will this mean we order three by accident ?
i have no idea what has been ordered - last week i could see this time its all in code . please resend with descriptors .
thanks
louise
