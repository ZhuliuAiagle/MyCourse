Subject: california update - - 09 . 20 . 01 - - 8 am pdt
attemps are still underway to persuade the california puc not to suspend da at today ' s meeting .
however , the best information we have at this time is that the puc will suspend da today , but will not suspend da retroactively .
as best we can tell , if the puc suspends , it will suspend da effective today , september 20 th .
in addition , there is a considerable effort underway - - from both ends of the spectrum - - to persuade the puc to reject 1 ) the proposed rate agreement between the puc and dwr and 2 ) the proposed " revenue requirement " that dwr submitted to the puc .
we ' ll report back with the results of the puc business meeting as soon as we hear them .
best ,
