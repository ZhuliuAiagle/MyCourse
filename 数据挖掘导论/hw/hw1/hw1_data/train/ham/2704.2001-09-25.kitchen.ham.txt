Subject: regrouping of enw budget discussions
louise ,
to make our enw budget discussions most meaningful , we felt that coupling discussions of the operations and it development budgets will make the most sense . to insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our enw 2002 plan meetings and to schedule these meetings around thursday as a religious holiday , i have worked with wes colwell and made a trade with vince kaminski to make all of this happen . there is no change to your calendar in terms of date , time or location of meetings . we have simply realigned topics and attendees as follows :
