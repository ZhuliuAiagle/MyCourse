Subject: project
hi michelle ,
chris , helen and i met this afternoon and discussed about
the project . we think the following course of action is appropriate .
the model interface will be in excel spreadsheet , with most
of the inputs ( from enron as well as from the consultant ) hiding
in an access data base . the access data base can be update
when needed . the engine will be written in visual basis code and
be linked to excel through xll ( or dll ) .
helen has been discussing with ken about various
aspects of the model and will finalize the access data table
form with ken . in the mean time , helen and i will start working
on code this thursday ( she will be in training wednesday ) .
best ,
alex
