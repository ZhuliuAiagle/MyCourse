sorry it was not clear . we pay them $ 200 mm + + and sell them 7 x 24 power for $ 61 . the $ 200 mm + + is the pv difference between $ 61 and our actual offer ( $ 39 ) .
this enables them to get cash and also recognize earnings on part of their dwr contracts .

their current capital markets stuff is going well - maybe we ' re wrong about them .
in your previous email by the way - did you mean we pay them or they pay us . i read they pay us but carl tells me it was the other way .
