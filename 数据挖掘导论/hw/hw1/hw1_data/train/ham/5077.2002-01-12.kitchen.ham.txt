Subject: cuts
hi louise ,
i asked each of my directs to consider 3 levels of cuts . i told them this is strictly an exercise at this point and that we haven ' t been given targets ( trying to keep the emotion down ) . the three levels were :
a . remove capability for new projects but retain a reasonable ability to continue growth of our current application suite .
b . reduce to minimal development capability . retain ability for operations and minor enhancements to applications .
c . cut to life - support level . retain ability to operate the applications and fix bugs .
the cut levels are as follows :
a . reduce by 11 ( to 129 )
b . reduce by 21 ( to 108 )
c . reduce by 17 ( to 91 )
jeff johnson placed himself in the a cuts , though i removed him from that cut thinking i can talk him out of it . he is in the b cut .
steve stock placed himself in the b cuts .
michael guadarrama placed himself in the b cuts . he said he would probably leave if the a cuts were made but would wait until we got through the transition .
hopefully we can hold this together .
i ' ll try to call you to discuss .
thanks .
