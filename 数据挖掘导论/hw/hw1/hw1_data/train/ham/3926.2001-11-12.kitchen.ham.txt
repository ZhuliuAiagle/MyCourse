Subject: customer - wants to sell back gas options
louise , i know last thursday and friday we had difficulty buying options from customers .
since friday , i have a customer ( tamsa ) , that wants to sell back to ena , some south texas index options , for an amount close to $ 4 . 8 million in premiums .
when do you think we can get back to normal trading ? please advice so we can act accordingly . best regards .
