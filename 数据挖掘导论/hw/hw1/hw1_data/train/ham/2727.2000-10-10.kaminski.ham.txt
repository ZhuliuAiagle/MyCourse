Subject: bollerslev seminar
vince :
i don ' t know if you noticed that we have tim bollerslev on the seminar
schedule for december 8 . in order for tim to get back to north carolina on
friday , we need to move the seminar time . i thought that the enron folks
might be interested in his talk so i wanted to get you input on a new
time . i know that 3 : 30 is best but would over the noon hour be second best
or would 2 : 00 be better ?
thanks .
