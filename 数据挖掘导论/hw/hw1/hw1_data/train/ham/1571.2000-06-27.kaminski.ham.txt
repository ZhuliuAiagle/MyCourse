Subject: re : running credit model
tanya ,
although i ' m quite comfortable with providing support for running the model ,
and assisting in providing the tools to enable easier analysis of the
results , i ' m not entirely comfortable with supporting a java debug
environment within your team ( including ad - hoc training ) , when we have
facilities within the it development team to do it here .
i ' d like to meet with you to discuss this , as this seems to be an ongoing
issue , and would like to understand the ground rules by which your team
operates in conjunction with it in general .
regards
steve

subject : re : running credit model
steve ,
in order to be able to test the new credit model as well as to answer credit
group ' s
questions regarding the outputs from this model research needs to be able to
do the following :
1 . run credit model independently of the other runs . it is quite ok for now
to be able to run it just for small artificial portfolios .
2 . debug the code to see what actual values are used during the run time .
please , let me know if your team can help us .
