Subject: proceeding
louise ,
i know you ' re swamped , so i am emailing this :
i ' m happy to proceed as soon as appropriate , as we discussed , on the assumption that you will be successful in preserving my bonus for this year .
i ' d like to rally the troops and get started on preparation for the next step , but before i can do much , we need to :
- make it official that i will be in charge .
- confirm or deny the following assumptions :
- we will have a new name
- we will want a slightly changed look for the new name , but still recognizeable as " the old enrononline "
- the new name will in fact be a new entity ( requiring assignment of old pa ' s or new pa ' s as appropriate ) .
i will keep a low profile until i hear from you .
