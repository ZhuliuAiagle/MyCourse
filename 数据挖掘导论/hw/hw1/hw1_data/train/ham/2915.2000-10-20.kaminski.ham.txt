shriley :
i ' m terribly sorry it ' s taking me so long to get back to you . because i am
moving to a new office after my trip next week it is difficult to make
definite plans . looking at my schedule now i would suggest tentatively
that i could come on friday november 3 . again , i would like to reconfirm
with you after i return from montreal a week from now .
i would also be interested in having a phone conversation with someone
who can tell me in a bit more detail about enron ' s research group and this
particular position . that would be very helpful in preparing to come to
houston . please let me know if this is feasible .
thanks for your patience .

thanks for your message . our e - mail system was down all day
yesterday so i was not able to respond until today .
i am very interested in coming in for an interview . unfortunately , my
schedule will make traveling on a weekday difficult for at least the next
two weeks . i am travelling as part of the us delegation to the g - 20 on
the 24 th and 25 th and will be busy until then in preparation . immediately
following that trip i will be moving to a new office here in treasury and
am not sure about my schedule .
i would like to wait until next week when i have a better idea of my
schedule to propose times to come to houston . please let me know if
there are time constraints on your side .
thanks ,
mark giancola
