hello
i know kal is moving on to pastures new , i am sure both of you continue will to do the outstanding work you have done working with kal without him . with him leaving you both jump up one level . brad is a good guy so get to know him and see how it works out - i ' m sure it will . if you have any problems come and see me and i ' ll get kal back ! ( joke ! ) but seriously my door is always open for a chat .
louise
