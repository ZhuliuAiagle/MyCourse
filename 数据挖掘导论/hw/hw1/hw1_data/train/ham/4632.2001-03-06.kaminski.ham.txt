i am just wondering whether you have received the
email i sent to you a couple of weeks back . in that
email , i asked whether you would have time to write me
a recommendation letter to support my application for
a master program ( mathematical finance ) in columbia
university this coming fall . if you will be able to
write the letter , would you please let me know ?
thanks a lot .
best regards ,
vincent tang
