Subject: re : meeting with you last week ?
scott ,
not at all . i left to make a quick call and it required a number
of follow - up calls .
the presentation was very interesting and professional .
one of the guidelines we have in my group is to avoid using too many software
packages .
otherwise , everybody will have his own pet package and we shall lose
economies of scale .
i shall talk to my associates about your product and get back to you .

subject : meeting with you last week ?
hello vince ,
i ' m writing to follow up with you regarding our meeting last week . did we
do something wrong in our presentation or in the set up of this presentation ?
for a group of 50 researchers we were expecting a larger crowd and also
some peole perhaps from your it department . also when you left i was
wondering if we had offended you .
the ability to use our products to create open models , integrate databases ,
c , vb , etc . and then quickly deploy them to others has been embraced by
the risk management world . we met the following day with a large group
from ees and they seemed quite enthusiastic about the innovation possible
with our tools .
i realize you are quite busy , but could you please let me know what
happened and how we can prevent this in the future ?
thanks
scott wakefield
