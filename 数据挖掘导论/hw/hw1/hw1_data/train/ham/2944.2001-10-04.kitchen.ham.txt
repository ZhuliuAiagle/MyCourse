chris ,
i have received a number of emails . only one ( cp & l ) was asking specifically about the turbines . the other two ( calpine and nrg ) are more interested in the turbine call option concept as a risk management tool .
i will keep you posted on the contacts . i placed a call back to cp jacoby , ben ; wiggs , brett

silence from chino the last 2 days . we were supposed to hear tuesday am .
marine diesel is bringing a buyer to site tomorrow . supposedly they are ready to go for a project overseas with a jv between hq and probably the main utility in france . they are ready with funds for the deposit . of course i ' ve heard that before , but the broker is very excited so it may have some truth .
nevertheless , i gather you ' re pressuring steve to go click live on eol . i understand we need to move on this , and just pray no one is so foolhardy to click until we get these other buyers sorted out ( unless it ' s a front run of these potential buyers chino and the french outfit ) .
also , tesco is back in the game with the california power authority and water district - their timing is early next week .
