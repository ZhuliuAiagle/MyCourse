rhonna ,
please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this
message ( vince , it would great if one of your team could attend since we will
need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project ) .
the prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps
required to implement the hr associate groups recommendations for the
development of an hr " value index " at enron .
i would anticipate we will need approx 45 minutes .
