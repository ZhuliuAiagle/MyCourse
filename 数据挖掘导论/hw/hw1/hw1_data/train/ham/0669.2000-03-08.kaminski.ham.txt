subject : meeting for friday on storage
hi mark , i have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you . i
would like to discuss with you and possibly with john bloomer and richard
reichardt about the ebs research ' s role in supporting the storage market
development from the origination and trading perspective . there are several
people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is what ' s my
take on our involvement - - please correct me or suggest otherwise .
shalesh ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort . in addition to his effort
with your group , he is presently supporting jean mrha with pricing and
standardization for a traded storage maret - - stinson gibner is directly
supervising him in this effort .
shalesh came to us through referal from david cox - - david discovered him at
one of his speaking engagements . shalesh had talked to david about traded
storage market development some time last october and david refered shalesh
to enron research group . we hired shalesh for general analyst position and
now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort . currently , he is
our point person ( with stinson or i supervising his effort ) who is supporting
jean mrha and you on the subject . kara knop has aproached shalesh with
request for some support and shalesh and she are sorting out each other  , s
role in this regard . as per my discussion today with david , we need to
coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market
assessment etc . for this i suggest shalesh and his effort so that all parties
involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source . based
on david ' s and my assessment of shalesh ' s capabilities , i would like to
suggest that the commercial heads use shalesh for his creative thinking ,
understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for data
gathering and simple research effort . we can add other staff as we see the
need and as you request them .
please respond this e - mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan , so
that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner .
kind regards ,
ravi .
