another little adder to this concept . whether it ' s wholesale or retail , the offer for this product would come from me - - either by way of badeer on the wholesale side or richter on the retail side . i have no interest in getting short in silicon valley . we don ' t have transmission to get to this highly congested area . there are huge risks associated with redefining npl 5 into separate zones and large congestion charges associated with getting to the sf penninsula . this area looks a lot like zone j in new york . not a place you want to be short .

just a little noise from the field offices . . . no need to do anything but i thought you should be aware of a little skirmish . ader ' s version is different - he says he only precluded mike and laird ' s involvement after receiving a lot of negativism from them about the ees concept . also , he thinks that svp liked the product offering . my opinion is that this a wholesale customer / opportunity .

mike that i would tell svp that ees ' s proposal is a wholesale product replicating svp ' s core competency of delivering a fixed priced , load followed product . mike and i had a somewhat heated discussion with ader about their product offering . ader characterized the product as retail on the basis that it would be sold one customer at a time and involved load following . that the product is to be sleeved through svp ( actually sold to svp for re - sale ) and therefore is a wholesale product was dismissed . ader also indicated that ees would be offering behind the meter demand related services , which further characterized their product as retail . what is clear is that ees is searching for physical power sales . they can offer behind the meter solutions without the help or involvement of svp . their product offering , once the decorations are removed , is a physical power sale .
as was our concern , we will now have to manage this issue , reacting to ees ' s actions .
ugh ! ! !
