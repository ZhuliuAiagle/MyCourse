Subject: re : kid ' s center
i ' ve confirmed that the 1 / 2 block on the east side of the kids ' center will be vacated by clark construction in january . that will give us time to see what kind of a problem we may have and to develop sketches and pricing on alternate drop off arrangements .

subject : kid ' s center
i met savita puthagai a couple of days ago and ( without me saying a word to her on the issue ) she told me that she is not moving her child to the kid ' s center due to the problematic parking .
so its not just me !
