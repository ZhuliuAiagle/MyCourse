Subject: re : moving roy ibasco
hi vanessa :
you will need to fill out a " churn request " and forward it to the " move team "
they will take care of everything that you put on the form . i am attaching a
copy
of the form for your information . the receiving department is responsible
for
doing this . he will need boxes to pack his belongings ( ask him how many
he needs - he will have to do the packing ) . the only item that moves other
than his personal items , is his telephone . the computer , chair , etc .
belongs to
the research group .
if you have any questions , or need help , please let me know .
thanks !
