Subject: master firm agreements
stacey and ellen :
in light of current circumstances , if a counterparty has both a master firm and a gisb , please confirm all firm physical transactions ( both telephonic and eol ) under the master firm and not the gisb .
additionally , could one of you provide me a list of eol counterparties who have a gisb contract listed as their master agreement for eol .
thanks ,
jeff
