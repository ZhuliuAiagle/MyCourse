stinson ,
krishna mentioned that tom wants to buy ( may have bought ) xpress . tom ' s
argument is that xpress ' s language allows the user to express special ordered
sets ( certain types of constraints ) in a convenient fashion . chonawee and i
just talked to two of cplex ' s consultants ( whom i know personally ) . they both
mentioned that these sets are recognized and handled implicitly within cplex .
as a result , there is no need for their modeling language to express these
constraints explicitly .
as a result , i feel that we should go with cplex . both chonawee and krishna
seem to have the same impression . i need to get a final vote on this one so
that we can order the licenses . this has been dragging on for too long .
