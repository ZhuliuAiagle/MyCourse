Subject: fw : canada origination
hi louise ,
can you please provide some guidance ? originally what we prepared for you has been an origination schedule each month . as you know , we ' ve since added mpr items . several commercial folks are now requesting that we add in accrual items . are you okay with this ?
would you like to see two schedules each month - one with only true originations , then an additional report that includes originations , mpr , and accrual items ?

i have differences with canada on the originations schedule due to accrual income items . i have not included the accrual income on the originations schedule for louise . please advise .
please note that the spreadsheet has 4 tabs and the discrepancies are highlighted in pink .
thanks .
have a great day ,
carol l . carter
