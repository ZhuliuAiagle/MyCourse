we finally connected .
beau normark ( sp ? ) , abb president is coming for a visit to the local abb office and wants to meet with enron as part of a general meet n ' greet ( as suspected ) .
they don ' t have any particular agenda in mind , but will probably want to talk a bit about the business relationship enron and abb have enjoyed in the past , our current projects ( e . g . texmex ) and any plans we might care to share about the future .
