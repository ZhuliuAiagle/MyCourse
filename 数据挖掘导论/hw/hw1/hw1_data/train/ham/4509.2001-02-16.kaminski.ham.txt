Subject: hiring of wharton tiger teams members for summer associate
positions in research
vince :
just want to confirm our conversation regarding your interest in the wharton
tiger teams 1 & 3 and your intent to hire interested members into the summer
associate program . you stated that you could take all members into your
research group for the summer . kristin gandy is now in the process of
obtaining from either you or members of your department the names of the
individuals on teams 1 & 3 . some of these individuals may have interviewed
with us during the campus process . if they did and were turned down by the
team for a summer position , we will not extend offers to those individuals .
otherwise , if you are willing to take the additional tiger team members into
your group based on the experience you and your staff have had in working
with these students , then the associate program will facilitate those offers .
at mid summer and the end of the summer , these wharton mbas ' performance will
be evaluated and cross - calibrated with other summer associates to determine
whether they receive an offer to join the full - time associate program .
offers will be given to those summer associate who achieve extremely high
performance ratings .
as soon as kristin receives the names of these individuals and determines
which members did not already interview , she will get out both a verbal and
offer to them .
as follow - up , jana giovannini , manager of staffing in career development ,
will staff those that accept our offer from this tiger team list into your
group for the summer .
should you have any questions or concerns , please feel free to contact me .
regards ,
celeste roberts
