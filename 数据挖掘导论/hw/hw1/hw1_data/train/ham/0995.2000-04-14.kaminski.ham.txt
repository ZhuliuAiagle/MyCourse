Subject: gas & power marketing & trading study
vincent ,
i enjoyed meeting with you yesterday and discussing our gas & power
marketing & trading study . we really hope that enron is able to participate
this year and we will work with you to address your concerns . i believe
that the problem last year was primarily due to concerns over releasing data
in general and not our study in particular .
i am attaching an electronic copy of the latest version of the input sheet
for the study . it is far easier to read on a computer than in print .
please remember that enron does not need to answer every question to
participate and that all results are reported back in a blinded format . the
only data points identified by company are the data points for the company
values of the company receiving the report .
if you have any further questions regarding the report , please do not
hesitate to call john stephenson or myself at ( 713 ) 523 - 8001 . have a great
weekend and thank you for your efforts to enable enron to participate in
this year ' s study .
sincerely ,
richard murphy
