thank you to you , ken and christie for coming to campus for the enron tiger
team mid - project review . the students are working hard and appreciate your
insight and suggestions to the project . thank you for your support of the
wharton school .
kim whitsel ( whitselk @ wharton . upenn . edu ) of tiger team 1 has informed me
that she is very much interested in a summer internship at enron this year .
i don ' t believe some of the students understood the process you had setup
for them at enron as part of the tiger team . being concerned with having
summer employment , they interviewed with other firms and ultimately accepted
positions . the students asked that i express to you that this does not mean
they are not interested in full time work at enron next year . i apologize
and take responsibility for the lack of communication in this regard . i
think it is a lesson learned and perhaps , in the future , we can make the
agreement to students understood in advance of their " dedicated interview
week " and eliminate their need to interview at all . this can also be an
added advantage of applying to be a member of the tiger team .
please let me know if you have any questions and exactly how kim whitsel
should proceed .
thank you ,
