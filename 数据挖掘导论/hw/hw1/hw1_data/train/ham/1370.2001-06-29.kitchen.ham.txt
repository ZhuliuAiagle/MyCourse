Subject: enron de mexico analysts
louise , regarding our 2 external analysts in the monterrey office , which are now " outside contractors " , and according to our previous conversation , i am sending you the numbers you asked for :
gabriela cantu and alejandra reyes , both have a bachelors degree in economics from the tec in monterrey ( equivalent to the us mit ) , with post - graduate degree in finance . both work for us and help us elaborating the newsletters , doing nat gas market research , and helping us quote derivatives to customers , and elaborate natural gas and fuel oil presentations .
we did not hired them directly . we contracted an hr company , to which we pay a monthly charge in exchange for technical services performed by their personnel . in principle , this scheme helped us find the right people since we could ask for a change in personel if we desired . it also gave us other benefits like not having a head count increase at that time . we also have a signed confidentiality agreement with both of them .
today , we pay the hr company the following , per person , in us dollar equivalent per month :
services invoice : $ 1 , 660 . 00
15 % vat tax of the invoice : $ 250 . 00
total payment : $ 1 , 910 . 00
however , net income to each analyst per month is around $ 780 . - usd per month .
gabirela cantu has been helping us since january 2000 , and alejandra reyes since december 2000 .
it is not a great expense , and they are of great help to our team .
best regards .
