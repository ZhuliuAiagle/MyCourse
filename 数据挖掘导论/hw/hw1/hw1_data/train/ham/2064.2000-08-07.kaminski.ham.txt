Subject: re : mit / aa lab - next meeting
amy ,
i think that rick causey wants simply to obtain more information to make a
reasonable decision .
we should cancel the meeting for the time being and let rick obtain
clarification of some issues from aa . i would agree that aa came up with a
rather
vague concept of what they want to accomplish .

subject : mit / aa lab - next meeting
vince : can you shed any light on this ? i ' m confused ( really confused ) . . . .
do you think this means the decision to go ahead / not is going to be made only
by kean , buy and koening ? and
do you think this means that we shouldn ' t meet on thurs ?
personally , i think enron really needs to meet on thurs to buckle down and
start developing some idea of needs / wants with regard to the outcomes of the
lab .
from a practical perspective , if we can ' t get what we want from this whole
thing , rick ' s issue of " where aa is going with this " is really a mute point ,
isn ' t it ? so a working meeting might really be worth the effort .
would appreciate your insight and advice .
thanks .
amy
