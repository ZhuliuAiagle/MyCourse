our copel shares are falling in value . we have never marked this investment even though it is public . we currently own adr ' s - elp is the ticker . we are restricted ( i think ) in selling until july . at the current price we would lose 15 to 30 million .

copel is trading at $ 6 . 70 , down over $ 1 . 00 from thursday close . the rumor is that this is the aftershock of a 7 mm block trade last week .
