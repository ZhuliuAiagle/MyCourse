Subject: new listing
goodmorning everyone ,
last year we did quite a bit of christmas baskets , during the time we were in
the process of
another major move .
we are currently settled on all floors now , therefore our christmas basket
list will be cut more than half .
here are a list of the names that received baskets last year .
matt rodgers
chris hyde
darren prager
charlie notis
harvey freese
jon davis
maryam golnarghi
delores sustaita rodney keys iain
russell trina williams todd
butler pamela ford facilities
robert knight phillip randle mary
martinez daniel hornbuckle ( ozarka )
guy move - team
greg whalley
richard weeks
mary sue rose
there are several names boldly printed that probably will not receive the
baskets this year .
the christmas season is approaching therefore we must start preparing
.
please note that i will be out on vacation dec 13 th - 18 th , if possible i
would like your list of names
before my vacation begins whereby all baskets can arrive at their
destinations on time .
thanks
kevin moore
