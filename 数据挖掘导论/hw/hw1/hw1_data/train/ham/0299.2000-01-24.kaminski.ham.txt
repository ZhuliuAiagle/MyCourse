subject : alberto jimenez ( analyst program )
dear mr . gibner :
it was very interesting talking to you during enron ' s recruiting weekend the
first week of last december .
i am starting as an analyst next february and i have alot of interest in real
options . i have done much of my research in the application of real options
in the valuation of oil and mining properties using black - scholes , merton ,
binomial lattices , etc . i have also done forecast of commodity prices such as
copper and oil using both , a geometric brownian motion and a mean reverting
process .
i remember in our conversation you told me that your department is very
involved with real options so i would like to know if there is an opportunity
to talk either on the phone or once i am in houston the first week for the
orientation . because i am very interested in working in your department . i
won ' t be in houston until february 6 th , but you can reach me at 310 390 7817
or ajimenez @ mines . edu
looking forward to hearing from you .
sincerely ,
alberto jimenez
