Subject: re : contract commitment data
need michelle to help categorise under headings i suggested . michelle , if you agree with my analysis can i ask kari just to resort these so i can give to lavo tomorrow in that format ?
clearly , the below is useful , but what lavo asked was , which ena contracts do we really have little chance of enforcing or are in danger of defaulting under . as such while we know per below that some of attached we haven ' t delivered on , i want to make sure we give him an indication of whether that it itself mean we have no argument to enforce .
