Subject: forthcoming unfavorable new york times article
as a heads up , we just got an unconfirmed report that jeff gertz , investigative reporter for the new york times , is apparently writing a " front page story " for the nyt . while still in draft , the article will focus on " enron price gouging in california . " that ' s about all we know at this point , but will try to learn more details .
by way of background , i understand that gertz is a pulitzer prize winning journalist . he has a reputation of being aggressive . his last two nyt articles have been on the california situation and were entitled " some evidence of overcharges " ( mar 23 ) and " critics say u . s . energy agency is weak in oversight of utilities " ( also mar 23 ) . by way of some of my personal interests , he also broke the story on the los alamos wen ho lee spy case and subsequently in february a sccop on the fbi bungled investigation of lee .
