acquire enron and provide immediate liquidity support by investing $ 1 . 5
billion . further , we believe the group simply remains oversold . the pure
play power producers are trading at a 7 % average discount to their private
market asset values .
4 . notes from mirant meeting mirant hosted an upbeat analyst meeting last
tuesday . mir reiterated that 80 % of its 2002 forecast is supported by
earnings from hedged ( generation and natural gas ) and franchise businesses
( distribution ) . mir also provided an in - depth review of how it accounts for
its risk management activities . management noted that it could maintain its
credit rating without any new equity issuance over the next 12 months .
however , it would be eager to access the equity market should conditions
improve in the near - term .
5 . power market update last week the us power markets were generally weak
across the country owing to mild weather and falling natural gas prices .
while the mirant national power index fell 17 . 1 % last week , the natural gas
week composite spot price fell 23 . 2 % . spark spreads improved in the
northeast and texas , while compressing in california and the southeast .
6 . debt market update credit spreads tightened across the sector last week
due to diminished ene concerns and positive stock price performance .
regards ,
