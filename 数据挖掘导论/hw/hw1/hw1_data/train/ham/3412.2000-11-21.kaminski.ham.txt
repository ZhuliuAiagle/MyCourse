i just got word that your bottom line needs to be 2 , 200 k . this is net of
corp charges and intercompany billings . in order to get to this number , we
have to reduce your budget by 83 k . do you have any suggestions in which
category ( ies ) we need to reduce ?
budget 10 , 521 , 000
i / c billings 8 , 238 , 000
subtotal 2 , 283 , 000
per delainey 2 , 200 , 000
need to dec by 83 , 000
