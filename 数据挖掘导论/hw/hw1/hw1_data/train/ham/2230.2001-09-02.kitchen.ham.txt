on friday , the assembly failed to get its version of the edison mou out of the appropriations committee .
the bill must pass out of that committee before it can go to the full assembly for passage .
negotiations continue among assembly democrats about what the final bill should look like .
the assembly will try again to pass the bill out of the assembly on tuesday .
in response to the california puc proposed order , which would retroactively end direct access on july 1 , the assembly amended its bill on friday to include its own " date certain " for the temporary suspension of direct access .
the assembly bill would now suspend direct access beginning august 25 .
we are working with others to get the date of suspension changed to either 1 ) the date the bill is signed or 2 ) september 1 .
we will provide additional information on tuesday about the bill ' s status and our progress in changing the suspension date .

jeff

the assembly will attempt to pass its version of the edison mou ( sb 78 ) out of the appropriations committee today .
if and when that occurs , the assembly will also attempt to get the bill passed out of the full assembly today .
it will be a very long putt to get both accomplished today .
if and when the assembly gets the bill out of the assembly today , the bill will move over to the senate , where the chances of passage are even more remote .
that said , davis is making a full court press to get the bill passed out of both houses for his signature .
will report back with the events of the assembly .
don ' t hesitate to call if you have any questions ( 415 . 782 . 7822 ) .
