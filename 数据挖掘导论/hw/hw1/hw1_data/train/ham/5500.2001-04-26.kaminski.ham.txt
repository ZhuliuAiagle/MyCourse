Subject: interview - numerical methods & finance
dear tanya :
it was a great pleasure to have met you . i very much enjoyed the interview and your insightfull questions .
i am keenly aware that many of the methods that i discussed with you yesterday are unique , new and not reported elsewhere . this is true both about the work i did in whole yield curve interest rate pricing as well as garch . the innovations stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience that i have both in turbulence physics as well as finance . they entailed considering the problem from its raw formulation , mathematical analysis , physical interpretation , taylored numerical method development , software writting and develoment and data management .
as to why i have not yet published anything the answer is that the driver in my work has been adding value to the business not publishing . publishing is however an option that has always been open with my former supervisor who is aware of the work that i did .
i not however that these results were possible only by exploring to the utmost extent the mathematics , finance , software design and data managemnet aspects of the problem . absence of any of these aspects is likely to cripple performance and execution .
please recall that as good as they were the performance measures that i mentioned to you were for a single processor machine . vastly better can be achieved with both soft parallelism ( multithreading ) as well as hard parallelism ( heterogenous network ) . this fo course allows us to step up the reach of the models used .
in fact i know for a fact that better can be done than what i mentioned in the interview . from work that i have been doing on the integration of the swaption volatility surface on the whole yield curve interest rate model itm and otm instruments can be included in both the callibration , pricing and hedging .
i look forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the opportunity of us cooperating .
best regards
joao
