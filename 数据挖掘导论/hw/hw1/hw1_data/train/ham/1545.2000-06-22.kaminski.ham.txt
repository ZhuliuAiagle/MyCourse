zimin ,
i will make sure that you have the opportunity to present your contributions .
it makes also sense to ask paulo every time to say a few words .

thanks for your reply . that is what i feel too : vince knows what we are
doing , so he does not have to ask us again .
in another dimension , i want to make sure that people like paulo get enough
incentive to perform . the group meeting , i
think , will provide a sense of accomplishment when other members in the group
know what we have been through .
thanks again for your understanding .

zimin ,
sorry if you get this impression . the real reason is that i treat
the lunch meetings as an opportunity to get updates on things
that are going on at more remote locations . i interact with each of the
members of your group daily and i know what ' s going on .
i agree with you , however , that the lunch meetings are not exclusively
for my benefit , but also for the benefit of the other members of
the group . i shall make sure that you have the opportunity
to communicate your contribution to the company .

vince and stinson ,
the valuation group has accomplished a lot during last six months . the
number of
projects we are working on is keeping increasing . however , when comes to the
staff meeting ( thursday lunch meeting ) , we are often left out for updating
our projects .
this makes me feel that what we are doing is no longer interesting or worth
mentioning .
i am hoping that we can get more exposure , despite we are still in the old
economy .
