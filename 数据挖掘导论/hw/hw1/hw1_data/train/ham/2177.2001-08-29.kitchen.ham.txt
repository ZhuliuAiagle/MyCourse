fyi . aquilla ' s plan is described below .
i talked with martin chavez at kiodex and he confirmed as well .
i think the bigger issue is that other enterprises are starting to try to build businesses around their systems and operations . i think we have a good head start with commoditylogic and kiodex but we have to run even faster now .

brad ,
you are right , aquila ' s riskl 80 is similar to kiodex ' s offering . it is a web - based reporting and valuation tool ( no software downloads are needed ) . the difference is that riskl 80 focuses on reporting and valuation . in other words , riskl 80 does not offer pricing calculators as does kiodex ' s . it seems to me that kiodex ' s risk workbench is a more robust solution because it provides decision tools to price opportunities before transacting while riskl 80 is " after the fact " reporting and transacting . it looks to me that when commodity logic launches its risk valuation modules it will become more of a direct competitor to riskl 80 .
in its initial phase , riskl 80 is offering services to the gas market only . soon , they will offer the tools for the power markets .
riskl 80 ' s products :
otc trade preview - details of transactions as entered into system
daily / monthly futures and forwards reports - position exposures and daily pal ' s based on mark - to - market accounting
options valuation report - measures exposures due to options plus volatility calculations ( i . e . greeks )
daily / monthly total position summary - total picture of risk exposure in the portfolio
riskl 80 ' s target market :
similar to commodity logic ' s market . they will target medium to small shops that do not have the technology , staff , or resources to run sophisticated reporting and valuation in - house .
let me know if you have any questions .

see below . could you take 10 minutes and go to the riskl 80 site and give me a brief download on what they ' re offering ? it seems like a " kiodex - lite " product ( talk to brandon is you don ' t know kiodex ) but i want to make sure we ' re not in the same space .
thanks ,
brad
