we have invested a great deal in upgrades to our gis software and geographic datasets , purchased a large plotter , and hired another ' map guy ' . we are currently working on projects throughout enron , and we are collecting enron commodity - related geographic data and developing map - based applications that could be beneficial to many groups . we will be giving demos of these applications and much , much more .
we would like to present to you our current status , and also discuss the support that we can provide to take your business to the next level . please try to attend on thursday , and spread the word to others that could realize the value of our geographic information services .
thanks , and we look forward to seeing you there .
