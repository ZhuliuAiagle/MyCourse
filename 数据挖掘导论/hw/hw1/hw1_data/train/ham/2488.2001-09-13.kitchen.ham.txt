louise ,
this is better in my opinion . it tends to force better definition from the developer and his team . your costs are reduced when we have good definition .

to be clear this is not a major step change , nor is it designed to slow business . very simply , we are moving to the methodology used successfullly by the west power group which allows for clear billing and planning for all involved .

subject : cancellation of the master tasking letter
keith and brian ,
ena management has declined to approve extention of the master tasking letter . the result of this is that no funding is approved for any work by eos other than by the few specific tasking letters that have been approved for specific tasks . as of tomorrow , 15 september , the mtl will be closed and no further charges will be accepted against this charge number .
going forward , no charges for eos or other services outside ena will be authorized except those approved under a signed tasking letter specific to the relevant project . no tasking letter will be issues for approval until the responsible ena developer / originator establishes an ena charge number against which charges applied to a tasking letter can be charged .
we will attempt to schedule a meeting next week to wrap up costs and review any on - going critical needs . in the meantime , inform any of your staff charging to the mtl that this charge number is closed after tomorrow .
thanks !
mike
