Subject: meeting follow up
louise :
i enjoyed our meeting this week on ql qbr . if you have any follow up questions , please let me know .
brett contacted me today by e - mail with some cost detail on the ft . pierce unit . i plan to get back to him on monday , but wanted to know if you have reached a decision on how you would like us to proceed with the mhi turbine book . i did have several follow up conversations with chris calger on the topic , and he and i are both on board to proceed based on the approach we discussed in our meeting .
hope all else is well .
regards ,
ben
