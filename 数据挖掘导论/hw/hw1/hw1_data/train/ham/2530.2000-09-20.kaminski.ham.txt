steve ,
i am a lead recruiter at the university of california at berkeley for
enron analyst / associate program .
i contacted several friends who work at berkeley and received an invitation
from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly faculty seminar
of the dept . of industrial engineering and operations research .
the students and faculty members from the business school will be also
invited .
berkeley in general , and department of industrial engineering and operations
research in
particular , are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
( s . oren works very closely with severin borenstein ) .
my presentation will focus on the analyst / associate program . i shall also
have
an opportunity to discuss the power markets in california ( i expect many
questions ) before many experts who are very important to shaping
public opinion and regulatory agenda .
please , let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this
presentation
and in presenting enron ' s point of view in a more effective way .
