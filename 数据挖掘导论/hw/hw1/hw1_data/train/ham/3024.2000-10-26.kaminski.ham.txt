Subject: message from anjam s ahmad
dear all ,
on 25 th october i announced my resignation from enron europe to pursue other
opportunities . i just wanted to say that the past 3 1 / 2 years has been a
very interesting and positive experience for me , having been a key part of
such a dynamic and fast - moving organisation . enron is by far the best
organisation i have ever worked for , and i am proud to have had the
opportunity to work here and become a shareholder . i have found it a real
pleasure to have worked with such talented and interesting individuals as
exist within enron europe and enron corp in houston & portland and i
genuinely wish you the best of success going forward . i would also like to
take this opportunity to thank vince kaminski , john sherriff and richard
lewis for hiring me in april 97 and thereafter offering such interesting and
challenging projects to work on .
i have made some excellent friends at enron and hope to keep them - i have a
base in london and will probably be visiting houston soon , so please feel
free to stay in touch !
