peoples gas has backed down from their request for a letter of credit to provide " adequate assurances of payment " , as stated in their tariff . they will continue to accept a parental guaranty , which is due no later than december 3 ( and which teresa says is being processed ) . the amount at issue is about $ 40 k .
however , they are sending me a letter that will say , if there is any further downgrade in our rating , they will immediately require a l / c or cash deposit .
