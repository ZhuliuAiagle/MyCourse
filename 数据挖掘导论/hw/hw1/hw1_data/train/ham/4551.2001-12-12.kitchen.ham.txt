Subject: master vs . gtc
louise ,
i am trying to prepare a set of contract templates for newcoonline , which will give us a starting position to show to the new buyer .
there is an alternative for the gtc ' s , which i would like to address in advance :
a ) master agreements which appear online and can therefore be accepted online for online or offline business .
b ) the existing gtc principle ( derived from the long form confirms )
i have spoken to several people in trading and opinions are evenly split .
i prefer the simple gtc as it will help us to do more business sooner ( full masters will take longer for companies to review , and they ' re going to want to negotiate the full master , anyway ) .
what is your preference ?
