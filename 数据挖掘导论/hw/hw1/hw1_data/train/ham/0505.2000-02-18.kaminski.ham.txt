samer and i met this morning with sara ledbetter . she is starting the
groundwork for setting up a storage book and a streaming book for tracking
the e - powered products positions . they are having a meeting on next
tuesday to discuss this . samer will attend . this is a good opportunity to
start compiling the data that we will need for some of john grieblings
questions .

the storage book . any suggestions ?
