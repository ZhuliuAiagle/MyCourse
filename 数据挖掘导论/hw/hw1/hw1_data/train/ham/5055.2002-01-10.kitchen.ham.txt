Subject: phone numbers
just to get things stirred up : the estate will keep all the existing phone numbers and netco will get brand new numbers . netco should not want the old enron numbers ( clean break , new company , etc . ) . the estate cannot afford to switch numbers . i know this was a hot point for you so i thought i would let you know directly instead of finding it in a document at the eleventh hour .
