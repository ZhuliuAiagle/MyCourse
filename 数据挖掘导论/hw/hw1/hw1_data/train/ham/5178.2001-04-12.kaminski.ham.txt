bill ,
we spent about an hour with rick explaining the rationale behind different
solutions
and i think he has a better understanding of the models at this point .
i think he was asked by jeremy to look into it .

rick / vince ,
should this not be a credit / research initiative while the business unit
focuses on originating good economic transactions ? not to be complaining ,
but shouldn ' t ees be focusing on infrastructure issues rather than waste
resources on a project we are already moving forward on ? you can ' t run a
portfolio model , unless you have deals in a risk system ! how complex do we
want these models to be ? behavioral implications on credit default ? they
still don ' t seem to understand .
regards ,
bill
mark - please attend . you may want to include martin to help ees understand
the complexity of their deals .

hi everyone ,
i have run the model and , along with the contract briefs i have some
questions the number of trials , numerical roundoff , and random number
generator randomness statistical properties . the first two are not a problem
in this application but the last one could be . has anyone examined the effect
of using different random number generators on enron  , s aggregate credit risk ?
7 ) there is one last point here . for most of the above points , the " improved "
analysis could make the credit risk be higher .
