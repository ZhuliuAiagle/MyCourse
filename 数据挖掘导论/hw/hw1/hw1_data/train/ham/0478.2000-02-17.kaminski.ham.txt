subject : speakers for a ceo meeting with governor johanns
hello margaret . we are looking for a speaker for a meeting that is being
arranged with nebraska governor johanns during the first week in april .
the potential topic is a national perspective on pricing pressures / trends on
natural gas , electricity and oil and their impact on agricultural production
costs , as well as types of risk managment tools that are being used to offset
the price fluctuations .
do you know of anyone , either within the corporation or outside , who would be
available to travel to omaha to make this presentation ?
i would appreciate any assistance that you could provide , margaret .
thanks ,
beth jensen
