anne :
thanks for the prompt response .
i have some concerns about the performance guaranty . the guaranty document covers three specific contracts ( referred to as " transaction agreements " ) , but those contracts are not identified in the performance guaranty by contract number . i have reviewed schedule 4 . 13 and think i have identified the three contracts as # 96019120 , # 9604582 and # 96002879 , and i note that all of these contracts are also listed as " newco contracts on schedule 4 . 13 . however , the parties to these three contracts as listed in schedule 4 . 13 doesn ' t match the designation of the parties in the performance guaranty . obviously the three contracts have " changed hands " on both sides , i . e . , seller and buyer . since the performance agreement is an existing obligation of hpl , there must be a set of records that clearly traces and memorializes the changes in the guaranteed obligations , and we must see that set of records before aep can finally determine how to address the performance agreement . obviously aep doesn ' t want to create any unnecessary problems with entex as the beneficiary of the guaranty , but i want to be sure that this arrangement doesn ' t need some attention in connection with the closing . if you can make the relevant records available i ' ll very promptly review them and we can then decide if anything needs to be done before the closing .
thanks for your help .
