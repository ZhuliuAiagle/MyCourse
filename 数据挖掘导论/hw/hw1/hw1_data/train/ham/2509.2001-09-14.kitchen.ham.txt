conference for next week : i guess it doesn ' t make sense for you to travel , after all that happened this week .
numbers are great , we have 140 people confirmed already . i ' ll do the welcome speech , and steve ' s part as well .
i ' ll try to get some pictures , and send them out to you .
best regards .
