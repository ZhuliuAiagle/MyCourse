Subject: gas model
sorry so much time has passed since we last discussed your north american gas
model . i am however still interested in setting up a test process to
familiarize some of our key people with the model and the database , etc .
i am now reviewing the licensing agreement that you submitted in december and
will be back in touch soon . i need to discuss this further with the business
segments , but i suspect that our interest will be focused more on the long
term gas model .
another member of your firm had called last week , but i somehow misplaced his
name and number . i thought that an e - mail response would suffice for now .
my apologies .
regards ,
