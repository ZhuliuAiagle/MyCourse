ummm . don ' t see an issue with expenses , although i ' m sure purchaser will have arrangements with their own shipping company etc . , everyone i ' ve spoken too has a domestic relo program and citi in particular have agreed to meet any obligations we have previously made so long as we tell them now .
i ' ll see what else i can find out . only thing i ' d add to chris ' s note is an agreement that he will move to houston if we meet all " reasonable " costs .

chris will obviously be relocating to houston in the near future . we need to make sure we cover all of the expenses . how do you intend to do this under the proposed contract ?
