based on my discussions with jeanie slone , i believe she has been severed . i consistently followed the sitiuation to ensure she was retained and it was my understanding this was the way it was to be handled . i know there is not a policy manual on this situation , but i spoke with jeanie to ensure coverage . it is my understanding jeanie was discussing this matter with david oxley or you .
