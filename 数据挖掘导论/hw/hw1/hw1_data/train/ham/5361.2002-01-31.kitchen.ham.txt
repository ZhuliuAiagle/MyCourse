Subject: company priority list
louise ,
i have received a copy of a priority list which you had forwarded to credit .
this list is very similar to the top 50 gas and top 50 power lists which we put together with commercial - there are only a handful of companies different .
credit are asking for a prioritised list which has the specific legal names with whom we wish to trade .
the top 50 lists already have the specific legal name . we will add the specific legal name for the handful of companies which were on your list and not on ours , and forward to credit .
