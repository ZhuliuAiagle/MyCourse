rick ,
aram is coming to houston , in my view , to explore the possibility of coming
back to enron
( given uncertain situation under the scottish rule at the old pacificorp ) .
i shall suggest that he meet with you and / or ted murphy as well .
i can wait for karen to come back . it ' s not urgent . we are still working on
the volumetric risk module and the team is making a very good progress .
they gave a presentation today to rick carson and me .
we have to decide what comes next ( asset / liability model or
operational risk model ) .
