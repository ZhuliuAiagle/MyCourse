hi louise -
are you okay with adding two new lines to east power on the management summary - one to read options desk and one to read services desk ?

faith ,
i spoke with kevin presto this morning and he informed me of two newly created groups within east power . the options desk is headed up by harry arora and currently has margin reflected on the dpr . there is also a services desk which falls under lloyd will . kevin has requested two new costs centers to capture expenses and would like to see two new lines added to the management summary to reflect their p & l .
thanks , paula
