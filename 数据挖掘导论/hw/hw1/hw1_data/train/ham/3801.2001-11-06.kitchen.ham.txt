Subject: bookcases
i talked to kim kaase and she said the cost of the bookcases is $ 2 , 000 each and it will take 8 - 9 weeks to arrive . the reason we did not order them originally because we both thought they would go perfect with your new furniture . she will need to get approval from you if you would like to order them . they have been asked to watch the spending . if you want we can take them with us when we move and see what it looks like and if you don ' t like it we can bring them back .
