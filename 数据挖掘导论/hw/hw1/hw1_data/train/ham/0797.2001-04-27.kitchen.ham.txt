i ' m sorry but you will need to complete the entrust form with your election otherwise you will remain on core benefit and your current pension contributions . core cover is lx life assurance , 40 % permanent health insurance and 1 unit of group personal accident . i will send your a manual entrust form to your home address for you to complete if necessary
