subject : gtcs , forms and agreements
the goal is to finalize the gtcs and all significant trading forms and
receive ubs warburg comments and sign - off by both legal and credit by
the end of business on friday . to that end , bryan murtagh and sanjev
[ credit ] are coming down to houston tomorrow evening for meetings in eb
38 c 2 starting at 9 : 00 am on thursday and 1 : 00 pm on friday . this
timing is important in the overall rollout plan . peter keohane is also
coming to houston for the meetings to make parallel changes to the
canadian forms .
generally , the plan is to finish the financial gtcs , the isda schedule
and collateral support agreement paragraph 13 first on thursday . next ,
we should go to the physical gas gtcs , the enfolio master and the
adoption agreement . finally , we should proceed to the eei master and
collateral annex . also , there should be a discussion of the wspp and
any other western related issues .
on a separate track , all gas transportation and related gas agreements
( most of which are non - negotiable ) are being prepared by suzanne
calcagno , jeff hodge , gerald nemec and angela davis . these agreements
will also require sign - off by legal and credit . a discussion should be
scheduled on thursday or friday . on the power side , ercot issues
should be discussed , but otherwise the discussion of transmission
agreements etc . can wait until next week .
please identify all critical path issues to achieve the above - stated
goal . thanks in advance for all the hard work !
