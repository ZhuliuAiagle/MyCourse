jean ,
the ces asset management payments come out of bryce baxter ' s group . the first i heard of this issue was about a week ago from trevor . i just received copies of the invoices from bridgeline on 10 / 18 . greg has been reviewing the agreement and consulting with legal to research the ces obligation , as he and i were not familiar with it .
i will contact bryce ' s group to find out why they have not been paying the invoices , there may be an issue that i am not aware of .
trevor has stated that he is using me as the point of contact for all enron / bridgeline issues now that i am with this group . that is how i became involved with bryce ' s issue . there appear to be many outstanding cash issues between enron and bridgeline that have accumulated over the last several months and we are addressing them as quickly as possible .
please let me know if you would like to discuss further .
karen

attached is the listing of items that we have accrued but not paid as of sept 30 th . we do have several items due to bridgeline from enron . the first is that we have not received 16 months of the ces asset management payments from enron ( 16 x $ 50 , 000 = $ 800 , 000 ) and the second is the btu conversion adjustment to pad gas for aug and sept that jean has agreed to . this amount is $ 274 , 000 . net net , we owe enron approx $ 226 , 000 .
give me a call if you want a detail explanation on any of this .
thanks
trevor
