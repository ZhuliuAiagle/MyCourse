Subject: organizational changes
changes in enron ' s business require us to reevaluate how we approach the
engineering and construction function within enron . specifically , enron
energy services ' ( ees ) business has grown dramatically and that requires
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers .
additionally , in light of enron ' s continued emphasis on increasing our return
on invested capital , we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction
projects around the world . historically , these projects have been a primary
focus of eecc ' s activities . consequently we are making the following
organizational changes concerning eecc :
eecc ' s pipeline construction group , led by jerry martin , will become part of
enron transportation services .
nepco will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant
construction services to enron entities and third parties .
the remainder of eecc will become part of ees . larry izzo will report to the
ees office of the chairman .
these changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth
opportunities within enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our
employees . please join us in supporting and implementing these changes .
