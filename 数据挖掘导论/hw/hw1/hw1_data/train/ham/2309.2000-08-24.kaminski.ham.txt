vince ,
thank you for forwarding the following messages . i am sorry that i am just
now getting back to you , my lotus notes was down all afternoon yesterday .
we currently have the cal berkeley general presentation set for wednesday ,
october 18 th at 7 : 00 p . m . which works out well because it is just prior to
the time deadline for students to submit their resumes . the general
presentation is a general overview of enron , the program , the interview
process , as well as a chance for students to meet and chat with enron reps .
since this is the first year that we are recruiting from cal berkeley , i
think that it is important that i attend this event on campus so that i can
answer any interview process questions . i will check the schedule and see if
it is possible to move the presentation to the 23 rd . the only negative is
that i will not be able to attend because i will be conducting interviews at
rice that day . also , it is very difficult to find a location to hold the
presentation , and i need to check on location availability on the 23 rd .
however , i do think that we should take advantage of the seminar on campus .
this may mean that they are two seperate trips to campus . perhaps , we can
also set up some other presentations for the 23 rd or even the monday prior .
although i would like to be able to attend the class / seminar presentations , i
don ' t think that it is as vital as the general presentation .
what are your thoughts ?
thanks ,
ashley

dear vince .
i sent you a reply earlier this month but i haven ' t heard from you about the
date of your visit . our department has a seminar every monday . if you can
schedule your visit on a monday i would like to invite you to give a seminar
which will be attended by many of our graduate students and faculty and will
give you an opportunity to tell them about your program . with sufficient
lead - time i can advertise the seminar in the hass school to their financial
engineering students .
