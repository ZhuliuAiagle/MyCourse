Subject: re : storage meeting
dear rex ,
i believe there might be a few additions to this core group . i have spoken
with sherron watkins and she is handling the storage side of the deal from
product development perspective ( john bloomer ' s team ) and so she would need
to be a part of this core group . i am trying to determine who else is
involved with storage within ebs so that we don ' t replicate our efforts . i
am hoping that after tomorrow ' s meeting we will have a better picture of how
to go forward on this project . please let me know if you need any further
information regarding this project . thank you very much for your interest
and i look forward to meeting you in the near future .
sincerely ,
shalesh ganjoo

ladies and gentlemen ,
stinson just pointed out that i forgot to mention that the meeting is
scheduled
for tomorrow ( 10 th of march 2000 ) between 2 : 30 pm and 4 : 30 pm . it may seem
like
a very short notice ; however , we ( mark , mary , kara , mike , virawan and myself )
had initially set this time and date last week . in the future i will make
sure
that everyone is notified early . sorry for any inconvenience this may have
caused . thank you .
