Subject: re : research resumes
molly ,
below are the resumes sent to us by focus . vince suggested that we
interview one person plus sriram , who already lives in houston . karim looks
like the most qualified , but my fear is that we may not be able to afford
him . i am assuming that vince will want to hire at most at the manager
level . can you first check and see if karim would consider coming at a
manager level salary before we spend time talking with him . if he is too
senior , then we should talk to samir , who looks like a more junior level
person .
thanks ,
stinson

vince ,
see below for my picks based on the resumes . the others marked as " no "
might be ok as well , but did not seem to have as much slant towards finance .
