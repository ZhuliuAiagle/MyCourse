Subject: re : joint probabilities
michael
the updated probabilities are attached . the probability of reaching any fx
times rab multiple are the same as the original analysis . the probabilities
of reaching a given stock price are lower than the original analysis in both
the optimistic and pessimistic cases because the debt levels are higher , and
hence the stock value is lower for any fx - rab value .
