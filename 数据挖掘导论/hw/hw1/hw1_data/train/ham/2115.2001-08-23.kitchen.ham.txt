continued growth . " enrononline is still seeing growth and so is ice
( ) . i also think we are seeing a lot more financial
trading as well . there was plenty in the last year or two , but i think one
thing that has continued to change is the real upsurge in the kinds of risk
trading that these guys are offering . that ' s a movement that ' s likely to
continue in the both the gas and electricity markets . "

american electric power , bp , mirant , el paso , pancanadian and reliant . aep

" volumes aren ' t perfect , but they are the best and most clear thing that we
have in terms of gauging the size of these business , " credit suisse first
boston analyst curt launer told natural gas intelligence . " that growth you are
seeing is going to continue . this is an industry which really is only reaching
one third of the market that is out there for it . if you total all of the
things that these companies are doing right now , they really are only
addressing about $ 100 billion worth of what is really a north of $ 300 billion
u . s . energy market . there ' s probably three to five years worth left of
excellent growth because you are going to have a tripling of the market that
these companies address over the next several years before you and i have to
have a conversation about who has a better business model or who really can
gain market share and is doing things better than anyone else . "
