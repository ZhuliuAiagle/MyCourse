ken and greg ,
the gamma and cross gamma from our spread option appear to be correct .
one anomaly i found is the price change as function of maturity , see attached
figure .
it is odd , isn ' t it ? and the seeming gamma anomaly is largely because of
this .

zimin ,
i have been looking at the new transport model and there are some returns in
the greek calculations that i am not comfortable with . i have looked through
the formulas and do not see inconsistencies , but we are getting significantly
higher gamma values in ' out years ' than in the ' near months / years ' . rho also
seems to be very high throughout the curve . we are prepared to release this
model to be used on the floor , but would like you to sign off on the
calculations . i know that you have a meeting on this on wednesday , and
wanted to get you the model to review early .
a good example that i am talking about is on the tab " longterm 9 " . this is
the kingsgate to malin deal that we worked on previously .
please give me ( or greg couch ) a call with any questions .
thanks .
ken
