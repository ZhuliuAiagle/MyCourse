Subject: iris mack
vince : i received a phone call yesterday afternoon from iris , with a special
request of you . she says that she will have to break her lease when she
comes to houston . she will have a three - month period during which she will
have to pay rent ( march , april and may ) , at the monthly rate of $ 1 , 175 . she
is asking if we would be willing to pay $ 3 , 525 to compensate her for this
extra expense .
i have a phone call in to the relocation department to find out how much cash
iris will be receiving from us under the normal relocation benefits , and will
let you know as soon as i hear from them . i would imagine that it is a
fairly substantial amount , since she is moving from california and since our
relocation benefit is very generous .
