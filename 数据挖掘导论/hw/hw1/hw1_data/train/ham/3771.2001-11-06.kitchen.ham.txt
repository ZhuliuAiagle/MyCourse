this has been on hold for some time now . we need to increase the l / c to keep our foreign primary casualty coverage in place . the total value of the l / c would be $ 288 , 700 . it is not much of an increase we need , yet there is zero capacity from the bank to handle our request . failure to act could send a very negative message to the insurance market if we can ' t handle this small a request . just thought you should be made aware .

please advise the status as this increase needs to be in place no later than november 10 , 2001 or it will jeopardize the insurance coverage for enron ' s entities operating in foreign countries .

i understand the copr need to hold off on all unneccessary requests for l / c ' s or funding . we need to be careful not to jeopordize our insurance coverage . the small amout of the l / c coverage increase keeps in place valuable insurance cover . please confirm with jim or paul what the urgency is to ensure we maintain cover . if it needs global finace approvale as well , we can askk for it .
thanks .
