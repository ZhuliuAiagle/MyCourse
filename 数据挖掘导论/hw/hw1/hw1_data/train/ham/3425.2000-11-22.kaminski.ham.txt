Subject: proposal submission
francois and kent ,
hope this proposal reaches you in time for consideration for the upcoming
fma - european meeting . i normally don ' t like to commit myself to a proposal
but in this case i ' m very comfortable doing so in light of the status of
the project . as you will see this " clinical " paper is a study of strategy
formulation in a very innovative company that uses financial derivatives in
conjunction with real asset investments . the firm , enron , has been the
most innovative company in america for more than five years now and has
expanded its strategy abroad . we have the unique opportunity to document
the firm ' s strategy from the inside with my co - authors being members of the
corporate research staff that manage the pricing of the energy derivatives
in which the firm makes a market , as well as provide the analysis upon
which firm risk positions are managed . although , specific enron projects
have been documented and published , noone has captured the story of the
company visionaries that formulated and executed the firm ' s business
strategy . of course , what makes the story of particular interest to
finance scholars is the fact that the strategy hinges in very important
ways on financial innovations . this is going to be a very informative and
fun story to tell and i hope to bring along my colleagues from enron to
paris for the meeting .
thanks for asking me to join the program advisory board and i look forward
to your comments on the attached proposal .
sincerely yours ,
john
