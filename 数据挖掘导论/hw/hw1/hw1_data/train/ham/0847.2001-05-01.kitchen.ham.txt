louise ,
please find attached the revised hotlist for upstream products and bridgeline . i need to augment the transaction sheet associated with bridgeline , but brian is currently in a meeting . next week ' s version will include the strategies associated with the lrc / crawfish assets that are on bridgeline ' s balance sheet .
in addition , the storage deal update does not include any of the monetization opportunities of utility pad gas that upstream is targeting . we are meeting with jim steffes tomorrow . paul and i will present our storage strategy on thursday .
regards , jean
