Subject: interview
dear mr . kaminski :
i am very sorry to tell you that i have to cancel my interview with you
scheduled on feb 9 th . i had a job offer from citadel investment at chicago
with a deadline on feb 5 th . i have been trying to get an extension for the
past week and unfortunately it failed today . with this very short time
frame , it is impossible for me and enron ' s interviewing process to meet the
feb 5 th deadline . how unwillingly , i would not be able to visit enron for
after taking citadel ' s offer . i hope you will find another candidate from
our class . there are some people still available . i will be happy to help
you get in touch with those interested .
please keep in touch and i wish you well in your business !
