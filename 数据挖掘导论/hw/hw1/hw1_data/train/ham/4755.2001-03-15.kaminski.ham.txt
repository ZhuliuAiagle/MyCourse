hi david ,
i would like to check with you just to be on the safe side . i left our last
meeting with the impression that only naveen and i would be working together
on the raptors . however , i heard from naveen earlier today and he wanted to
include thomas ( mark , i presume ) in the meeting as well . i would like to
ensure if that is indeed your intention . please advise . thanks .
