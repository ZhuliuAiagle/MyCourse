Subject: meeting
louise and john ,
thank you for having the meeting with all gas and power origination this morning . i was very impressed by the employee attendance and your responses to individuals ' concerns . i would recommend having periodic meetings in the future . my only disappointment was the most of my questions should have been articulated by my employees because they were concerns and queries articulated to me these past few days . i have appropriately chided them and will chalk it up to stage fright .
regards , mrha
