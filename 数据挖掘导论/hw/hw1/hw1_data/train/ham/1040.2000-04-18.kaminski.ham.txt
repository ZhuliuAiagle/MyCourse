kevin ,
if you guys had aerons ( mesh ) and / or vecta ( leather ) chairs , my group
typically will not be responsible for the replacement of those chairs as i ' m
not aware of who has taken the chairs or where they may have gone . my group
does not stock these chairs , therefore we order as requested by business
units and charge your co / rc . there will be two chairs delivered to the
locations mentioned below , however , they will not be the vecta or aeron
chairs .
you may want to contact enron security and maybe they can investigate further .
thanks ,
reggie

reggie ,
there may already be a request floating around for a standard black office
chair for ebl 972 d . it was stolen over a weekend several weeks ago . in
addition to that one , my own chair at eb 3132 a was stolen this past weekend .
could you come up with a couple of decent ones for us ?
if you need to charge them to us , our numbers are 0011 and 100038 . as
always , call me if you need to at x 58322 .
thanks !
