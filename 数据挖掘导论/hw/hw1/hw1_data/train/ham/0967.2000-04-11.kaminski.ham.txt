Subject: resume , cv . , etc .
dear mr . kaminski :
as explained over the phone , i have been doing political , economic , and
strategic analysis for terry thorn , formerly head of government affairs for
ei . most of my work has been focussed on asia , a region in which i have deep
experience and speak major languages . wtih the restructuring of the
asia - pacific group , terry is moving to a new function and i am seeking a new
role . since i have been based in washington , dc , with more frequent trips to
asia than to houston , i still feel as though i don ' t know my way around the
company , a disadvantage in my current situation . several people have
recommended that i talk to you about your shop , but more generally if you
have any ideas about where i might fit in , i would appreciate them .
i am attaching my resume , cv and a biographical sketch as you requested ,
edith terry
enron / dc
