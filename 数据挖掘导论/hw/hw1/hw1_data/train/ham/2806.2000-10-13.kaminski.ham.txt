hi jeff !
i know you received the information below . additionally , i have 2 people
from broadband services meeting us there friday ( one is traci warner who set
up the rice u deal ) . further , i ' ll be meeting with amy briggs regarding the
entrepeneurship conference nov 30 th and dec lst . i ' ve already spoken with
her and tom piazze and both independently confirmed as you suspected that we
committed to sponsor at the $ 10 , 000 level . this entitles us to banners ,
panels , posters , and most importantly , a keynote address . i ' ll discuss the
keynote address with her but would appreciate your thoughts in advance as to
how you ' d like to see the keynote speech executed ( suggestions for topics ,
proposed speaking candidates , when in the conference you ' d like to see
enron ' s speech , etc ) . i ' ll review the trip with you when we return .
thanks jeff !
