per my voice mail to vince , martin lins offer letter will be provided to him
on thursday , august 31 , 2000 .
however , a concern was shared regarding the retention bonus we originally
discussed . therefore , based on his phd and market information we are able to
offer him a base salary of 98 - 100 k and no retention bonus . we can discuss
retention bonus after he begins his manager role in your group .
if you would like to discuss further please feel free to call me . otherwise ,
please approve salary structure of base 98 , 000 with no bonus .
thank you .
