goodmorning ,
shirley , we are in need of a printer that will allow us to print
several pages , none of the printers on this floor will permit
us to do that without adding memory .
i even sent the print - out to bandit and it also needs more memory to
print these pages .
what we are printing is 189 pages .
mike would like to print these pages , so instead of paying for
memory on someone else ' s printer could we add memory to
one of our own .
please inform . . . . . . . . . .
thanks
kevin moore
