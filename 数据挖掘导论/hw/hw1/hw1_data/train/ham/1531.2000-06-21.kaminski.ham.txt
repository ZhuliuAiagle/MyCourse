there is one additional item i would request : if the room does not contain
a blackboard or whiteboard , i would appreciate a flip chart and markers .
i am faxing you my presentation handout for tomorrow . i would be grateful
if your produced copies in sufficient number for tomorrow ' s 11 : 30 a . m .
meeting ; vince advises me the number of attendees will be in the 25 - 30
range . i will also bring along a " master copy " in case the trasmission
unduly mangles the fax .
thanks ,
ehud
