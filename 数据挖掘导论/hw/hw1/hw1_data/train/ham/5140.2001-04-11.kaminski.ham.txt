Subject: jacob feedback
vince ,
chonawee and tom halliburton had feedback about jacob to me .
tom ' s feedback is what he does for pros is actually too simple . their so - called
trading system is actually a scheduling system .
my impression is that jacob is good at selling himself , his knowledge
of finance and derivatives is very limited .

i asked jacob two questions to check his basic knowledge . he answered correctly in the optimization question so i believe that he has a good foundation on his optimization skill . i have a doubt about his stochastic skill because he took only one course in stochastic processes and his previous models are simple deterministic models . if we had more interview time i would be able to check his stochastic and modeling skills .
he completely failed to answer the second question , which is to check his basic risk management skill . it is clear to me that he has a very weak background in finance and risk management . he does not understand the relationship between a discount rate and risk . he showed some weakness in annuity calculation .
in conclusion , i feel that he has good basic in optimization but a very weak background in finance . based on his experiences , i have a doubt on his advance optimization skills , such as his stochastic skill and his ability to attack a complex optimization problem . i would recommend a second - round interview if he will be solving a complex - optimization problem .
