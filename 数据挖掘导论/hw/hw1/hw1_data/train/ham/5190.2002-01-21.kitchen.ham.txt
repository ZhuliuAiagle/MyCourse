Subject: peoples energy / ubs
in a strategic move to provide relative probability to moving enovate ( jv with peoples energy ) to ubs , i believe it is critical to show peoples our support of the office in chicago . the potential of this outcome increases two fold , by ensuring gregg penman and richard tomaski are employees of ubs . neither received an offer due to decisions made outside my control . we have now given odds that enovate will move into newco or be sold to a third party . i believe this outcome is disheartening to all of us involved . it was my goal to salvage as much of the pec relationship as possible and meetings held in chicago this week were essential as a first step . i have continued to believe in this business model whether with peoples or elsewhere and i belive strongly that gregg and richard are essential staff . they " know " how to run it and none of our competitors have suceeded in this business . .
my team believed in a business model and followed through in relocating their families , setting up a business with a " real " customer ( that enron all to often discounted ) and created something that a significant list of third parties want to buy ( bp amoco , oxy , sempra , pancanadian , el paso , sempra , cms , duke , and dynegy ) . this relationship has created over $ 130 mm dollars of mtm for enron without consideration of the information trading obtained . this was not a transaction , but a business .
my recommendation for gregg and richard is to immediately provide an offer that requires a non - compete of 1 year with consideration of $ 60 , 000 at 6 months and $ 60 , 000 at one year , with the promise of stock in year 2 .
we do not want these guys at a competitor or with newco . no one else in the industry has the ability to run as quickly as we will if we have this team together . you can hold me to that .
