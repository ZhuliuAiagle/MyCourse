( c ) 2000 phillips business information , inc .
oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and
production expenditures by more than they anticipated
at the beginning of the year , lehman brothers inc . found in a mid - year
update of its annual e & p survey . " the 326 companies
we surveyed are planning on an 18 . 2 percent increase , versus a 10 . 2 percent
rise budgeted in december , " said james d .
crandell , who follows oil services and drilling for the new york investment
banker .
he emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in lehman ' s survey reflects
increases in budgets for 2000 and not
underspending of budgets during 1999 . " among the companies that were
included in our december 1999 and may 2000
surveys , global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated
to have been spent during 1999 in december . it
also indicates that nearly $ 6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide
exploration budgets since december , " crandell said .
the survey ' s respondents said that they planned to increase u . s . e & p
expenditures by 17 . 6 percent , up from 15 . 9 percent
earlier in the year . crandell said that the greater increase was driven
almost entirely by independent producers . " in our survey ,
227 independents indicated e & p spending growth in 2000 of 26 . 1 percent
versus a 22 . 9 percent increase budgeted for the
year in december , " he indicated . " some 40 percent of the independents we
surveyed have increased their u . s . e & p budgets ,
while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last
december . higher natural gas prices and increased
cash flow are the main drivers behind this . "
crandell said that anadarko petroleum corp . ( nyse : apc ) , apache corp . ( nyse :
apa ) , bhp petroleum , h . s . resources inc .
( nyse : hse ) , mcmoran exploration co . ( nyse : ran ) , mdu resources group inc .
( nyse : mdu ) , mitchell energy and
development corp . ( nyse : mnd . a and mnd . b ) , santa fe snyder corp . ( nyse :
sfs ) , stone energy corp . ( nyse : sgy ) and
titan exploration inc . - now pure resources inc . ( nyse : prs ) - were among
the larger independents to make the most
significant upward revisions . the ones that significantly reduced planned
u . s . e & p outlays for the year included barrett
resources corp . ( nyse : brr ) , belco oil and gas corp . ( nyse : bog ) , burlington
resources inc . ( nyse : br ) , coastal corp .
( nyse : cgp ) , forcenergy inc . ( nyse : fen ) , houston exploration co . ( nyse :
hex ) , kerr - mcgee corp . ( nyse : kmg ) , mariner
energy corp . and williams production co .
the survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage
gain in their 2000 u . s . e & p expenditures ( 8 . 8
percent ) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year ( 8 . 4 percent ) .
among the 14 companies in this category , 31
percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 e & p spending estimates
during the first six months , including amerada hess
corp . ( nyse : ahc ) , conoco inc . ( nyse : coc . a and coc . b ) , occidental petroleum
corp . ( nyse : oxy ) and total fina elf s . a .
( nyse : tot ) . another 19 percent - including eni spa ( nyse : e ) , royal
dutch / shell ( nyse : rdp and stt ) and texaco inc .
( nyse : tx ) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates , while the
remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey
remained the same .
' the increase in canada . . . is nothing short of staggering . . . '
" the increase in canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is
nothing short of staggering , " crandell continued . of
the 85 companies that he contacted , 44 . 7 percent budgeted higher
expenditures for 2000 than for 1999 . " compared with
december , 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000
by more than 10 percent , while 20 percent
have reduced it by more than 10 percent . the remaining 39 percent have kept
it within 10 percent of what was originally
estimated , " crandell said . talisman energy inc . ( nyse : tlm ) led the group
with a huge increase , followed by anderson
exploration ltd . ( tse : axl ) , gulf canada resources ltd . ( nyse : gou ) , murphy
oil corp . ( nyse : mur ) , pan canadian
petroleum ltd . ( tse : pcp ) and shell canada ltd . ( tse : shc ) . like their u . s .
counterparts , producers above the border raised
their 2000 e & p budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash
flow , according to the lehman analyst .
he said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise : " the 14 . 9
percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas
companies that have operations outside the united states and canada was well
above the 5 . 7 percent increase for 2000
estimated last december . as in other geographies , there were more companies
that increased budgets than decreased them . "
overall , crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised
their 2000 e & p budgets by more than 10 percent , 43
estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated
that they would spend less than originally planned .
he said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which
materially increased their budgets , including
texaco , petroleos brasileiros s . a . , petroleos mexicanos s . a . and repsol ypf
s . a . ( nyse : rep ) among the multinationals and
amerada hess , apache , premier oil plc . and woodside energy among mid - sized
companies .
crandell noted that while respondents ' average price assumptions rose during
2000 ' s first six months ( to $ 22 . 04 from $ 19 . 25
per barrel of crude oil and to $ 2 . 58 from $ 2 . 38 per thousand cubic feet of
natural gas ) , they still trail current prices and what
lehman brothers estimates for the year ( $ 28 per barrel of crude and $ 3 . 30
per mcf of gas ) . " this suggests a stronger second
half than expected , should companies raise budgets further to reflect the
higher prices , " he said .
