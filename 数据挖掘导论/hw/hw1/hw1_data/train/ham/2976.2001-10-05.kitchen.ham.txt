Subject: org charts
louise ,
attached per your request are two org charts for the tech services group - - one for no adds and one including four staff adds . these are similar to what was presented to you before but adjusted to delete the third gas guy as discussed . staffing lists for each case are also provided .
i would strongly urge management to consider the staff adss proposed . especially in light of the move of eos to egs , it is even more important that we have sufficien capability to manage our business . one mis - step can cost us more than our entire budget .
i would be happy for the opportunity to discuss in more detail . in the meantime , let me know if i can be of any assistance .
