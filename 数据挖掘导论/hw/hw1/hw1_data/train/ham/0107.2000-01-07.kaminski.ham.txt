i do not think minor changes would allow you to just use the same file . you
will have to check with risk . this is risk books , a specialist division of
risk publications in london . address : haymarket house , 28 - 29 haymarket ,
london swly 4 rx .
the publication was in a book , entitled " credit derivatives : applications for
risk management , investment and portfolio optimisation , " publishd in 1998 . i
am not sure if a lawyer was involved , maybe vince will know .

hello vasant !
bijoya has updated me on the discussion you have been having on the article
from risk magazine about credit .
we have found that the attachments you sent her are actually not
word - for - word the same as the published version we have - the changes are
only minor , wever , and have not altered the article in any way .
my question now concerns the copyrights . since the version you sent is
slightly different , do you think this gives us the freedom to publish it
without the consent of risk ?
and if not - can you tell me if it was published by risk uk or risk in the
states ? and which issue was it ? i just want to have all of the details if i
need to call someone at the magazine . . .
also - was there a lawyer involved in the publication procedure , or was this
handled by london / houston pr ? or by vince himself ?
sorry about all of the questions . . . i just want to avoid problems well in
advance .
thank you !
regards ,
katja
