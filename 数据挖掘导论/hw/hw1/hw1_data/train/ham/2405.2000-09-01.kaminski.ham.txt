hi vince ,
i just got off the phone with donna piazze at wharton , ( i don ' t know if there
is a relationship with tom at wharton ) , and we were discussing there tiger
teams . it is a required research program , 2 nd semester for mbas , and wharton
would love to have enron participate . i told her there is probably some real
life reasearch project we could have the students do . she did also mention
that it is one of the best recruiting tools under development at wharton . . i
gave her your number .
her number is 215 573 8394 . please call her when you get a chance within the
week .
mark , can we get christy involved ? thanks everyone .
jeff
