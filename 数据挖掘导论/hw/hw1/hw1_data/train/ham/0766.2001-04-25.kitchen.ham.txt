Subject: new albany
louise ,
allegheny is no bid on new albany . they want to focus only on technology which allows for combine cycle conversion . the turbines at new albany do not accommodate combine cycle conversion .
they are interested in pursuing our longview development in washington , and we are going to follow up with them on a couple of sites in entergy .
it looks like i might really have to work at selling new albany ! ! !
