i do not understand the netco / newco comments .
clearly at this point enron the estate should maintain the space until it is sold to a new buyer . that would be a don miller / fallon final call - but i think its a no brainer .

under commitments to pec , enron has commited to provide office , computers , trading systems , etc . if this is changing , i need to know quickly . i have been provided indications from several outside counterparties , some divisions within newco and i thought netco as holding interest in purchasing the chicago business . due to the obvious indication of value for the joint venture with pec , i believe it imperative that the business / office be operational until march , 2002 , at a minimum .
please advise .

laura ,
i understand that the metals group has asked to keep the chicago office open until mar 31 to wind things down . do you have any new information on ena ' s chicago folks at this time ? we may ask for a 60 day extension under bankruptcy orders to terminate the lease .
thanks ,
tammy

ok
please check with don miller too . netco does not want san francisco going forward and probably not chicago .

we have asked epsc to pay the following leases for the month of january based on feedback from ena commercial leadership . my understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by feb 2 . i will revisit the status of these leases with you before february rents are to be paid .
calgary
portland
san francisco
chicago
denver
i have also been contacted by paula corey , who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed . i will keep you posted on the recommendations .
regards ,
tammy
