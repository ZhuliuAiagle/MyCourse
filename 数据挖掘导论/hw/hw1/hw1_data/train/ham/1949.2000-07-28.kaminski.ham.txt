hi - i have run the model for the 26 th and have the following results :
i have also updated the correlations to include silver and the gold .
the tc delta ( treatment charges ) are positions only for copper conentrate and
do not
contain any positions due to zinc or lead .
could you take a look at the figues as this is the first time i have done a
full run and
would like to make sure that i have done things correctly .
i will definitely call to discuss the prices for gold and cocoa beans - the
tc price curve is
another issue however , at the moment we do not have anything other than a
spot price and
a 1 year price so i think we will probably have to set it as a constant .
i have to talk to andreas soon as he is awaiting my comments on point ( 2 ) of
his email that
i forwarded in my last mail .
also , you will can see that i have subtracted any positions that are from r
wolf in the mercur download -
this was point ( 1 ) of his note .
as a quick question ?
do you think it is worth including zinc concentrate ( 18400 dmt ) and lead
concentrate ( 920 dmt ) ?
i think we may need to check the tc price for these and the conversion for
the one given in the model for copper as
i think that the original historical price file ( tchistory ) is quoted in c / lb
- i guess this is cents / pound ? rather
than $ / dmt which is the units that position is quoted in .
speak to you soon
