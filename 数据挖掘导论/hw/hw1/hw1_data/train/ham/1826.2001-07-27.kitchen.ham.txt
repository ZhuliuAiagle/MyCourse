Subject: re : spread
i spoke to mark and he outlined 2 potential fixes to the spread dilemma . we can leave it the way it is ( with some clarifying changes to the descriptions ) or we can ask either the gas or the power desk to completely change their products . neither one is a very elegant solution . jay and i are scheduling meetings with each of the desks over the next few weeks , and i would like to take that opportunity to diligence the issue in person with the traders . in short , we ' re working on it .

we have some inconsistency in the way we are doing spreads it was ok when it was us and uk but now we are doing it different ways here . andy will tell you that this was sort of forseen . we do need to sort out something - maybe more in the short description which helps to indentify what you are buying and what you are selling .
mark taylor is the guy to talk to .
