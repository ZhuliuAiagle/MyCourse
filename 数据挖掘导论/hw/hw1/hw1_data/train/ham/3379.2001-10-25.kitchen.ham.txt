we can not get the cost of funds data until monday to pull the current prm balance by counterparty . we should have the otc margin analysis through october soon . we gave it to you yesterday in two pieces , however , we will have it on one report today . georganne indicated that you have the nymex initial margin balances as of yesterday , it was net about $ 60 million . we will be receiving @ $ 25 million today . we can update that report for today . let me know if this is what you need .
