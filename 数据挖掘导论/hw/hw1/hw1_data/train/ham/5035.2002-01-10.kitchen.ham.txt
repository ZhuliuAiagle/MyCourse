louise ,
carl and i have done a quick once - over on leslie ' s gtc . i think the format she has chosen is doable , but i need clarification from her on some points .
it is possible that the market might accept an amended eei more quickly than they would accept our simple gtc - i don ' t know .
it is interesting to note that the eei amendments in leslie ' s gtc are 5 pages long ( excluding the elections sheets ) . our original gtc was 8 pages long .

louise :
attached please find the gtcs for power ( with and without credit ) . please note that we are actually using the eei master agreement as the on - line contract , as opposed to the traditional gtcs . we were actually in the process of making this transition on eol this fall , and kevin presto and tim belden have endorsed netco ' s use of the eei on - line .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments .
