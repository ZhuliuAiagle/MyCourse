Subject: re : anjam ' s term sheet
tara :
i am forwarding it to vince for his approval . it looks good although i have
three questions :
1 ) i presume that it is clear that enron pays housing up to 1500 / month .
anjam does not get a check for 1500 to play with . utility bills are not
included unless part of the rent , right ? this should be clarified ; as you
know , houston summers are a significant burden on the pocket - book .
2 ) economy class plane . can we even do that ? i thought enron policy was for
a b - class ticket for flights over 6 hours .
3 ) 500 lbs of transport . i don ' t know if this is a big ticket item , but i
would give him less , 250 say , if it would save enron considerable expense .
regards ,
grant .
