subject : uh lecture and potential career opportunity
dr . masson ,
i attended your lecture at uh and enjoyed it tremendously . if possible , i
would like to investigate a career opportunity with your group in particular
or enron in general . would you please review my resume and / or forward to
potentially interested parties ?
in tandem will all of enron ' s other propaganda efforts , your top - notch
lecture at uh spurred me to do some soul searching . i currently work at
duke energy trading and marketing , but have been extremely impressed with
enron ' s cutting - edge research and market - leading position .
i have a ph . d in electrical engineering from rice ( statistical signal
processing ) with two years of experience at duke relating to the valuation ,
risk management , and risk measurement of financial derivatives and physical
assets . i seek a similar position that would allow me to leverage my
quantitative skills and grow within in the corporation .
i believe i would be a great fit with enron and hope you would consider me
for a potential position .
best regards ,
matt crouse
