Subject: re : storage meeting
ladies and gentlemen ,
stinson just pointed out that i forgot to mention that the meeting is
scheduled for tomorrow ( 10 th of march 2000 ) between 2 : 30 pm and 4 : 30 pm . it
may seem like a very short notice ; however , we ( mark , mary , kara , mike ,
virawan and myself ) had initially set this time and date last week . in the
future i will make sure that everyone is notified early . sorry for any
inconvenience this may have caused . thank you .
