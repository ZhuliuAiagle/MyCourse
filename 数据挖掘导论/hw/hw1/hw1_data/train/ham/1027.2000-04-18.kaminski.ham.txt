margaret ,
first of all i apologize for not sending you the information to complete the
chart that you gave me . i have been travelling because of work and then
vacation , maybe i spent 3 or 4 full working days in the office in the last 4
weeks . now that i am going through my to do list i cannot find that page
that you gave me . could you please send it to me again ?
on the other hand i was wondering if maybe within enron possibly at info
central or with one of your friends at the trading desk you could get me a
copy of a book titled : chicago board of trade commodity
trading manual
isbn : 1579580025
publisher : fitzroy dearborn publishers , incorporated
pub . date : december 1997
it si not in stock at the dot com libraries and it will take them a long
time to deliver . i need this bbok in order to produce a document that steve
kean requested from me a couple of weeks ago .
thank you very much for your help .
best ,
ricardo
