strategy
* detail out key product and market strategies necessary to grow our existing business
* develop a trading platform for pipelines to post and transact primary natural gas capacity
* provide origination and trading groups with energy related geographic information ( gis )
* develop a regulatory position to present to the ferc proposing fundamental changes to current transportation trading rules
everything else can be left as is ( though i do not know where you got the 2000 forecast numbers since this group did not exist until this year )
