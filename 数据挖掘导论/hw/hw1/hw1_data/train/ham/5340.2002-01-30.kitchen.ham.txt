i sent revisions to the faq ' s and the cover letter to kal shah and
leslie hansen last night . kal assures me that all of the changes i
suggested ( including the deletion of any mention of ubswenergy other
than as part of a web address ) were being made . accordingly , i think
the message is getting through . also , in conversations with mark
taylor , i stressed that no trademark registration was to be made ,
pointing out that the use of the url was intended to be temporary .
mark had not had anything to do with a possible registration of the
mark , other than receiving a phone mail message .
we will see how things go , however , i believe the message has gotten
through for now .

the broader issue perhaps is that they appear to be naming / branding
the
on - line trading system ubswenergy and using that as a marketing name
for their business . for example , i had heard they wanted to
trademark
the term . even if they have approval to use the website name
temporarily , does it make sense to go out with a marketing name that
might be killed in 6 months - and for which we may not have approval
to
trademark ? maybe not a popular position if costas is behind this -
but
we should be sure everyone is clear on the possible ramifications .
just so you know , there are some intellectual property considerations
behind this . in order to best protect the ubs and ubs warburg names ,
group does not like us to weaken them by using ubsw .

this is the response that we have just received from group marketing .
all relaunch efforts have now had to be put on hold as switzerland
control the naming of the dns servers . pls could john or mike put in
an urgent call to heidi baumann to square this one away .

hi isabelle ,
on behalf of group marketing ( heidi baumann ) i have to reject this
request :
- www . ubswenergy . com must not be visible ( but may be used as a hidden
technical
url ) .
- e . g . " www . ubw - w . com / energy " would be ok or old - style :
" www . ubsw . com / energy .

hi judit , hi robert
we set the dns servers temporarily on what the customer ordered as it
seems to
be very time critical . it should be seen on the internet by tomorrow
at
latest .
nevertheless this activation needs to be signed - off . please do so
asap .
and
reply to hostmaster @ ubs . com
thanks , rgds ,

subject : ubswenergy . com : changing authoritative servers
it is crucial that the dns servers for ubswenergy . com be set as
follows ( as soon as possible ) :
dnso - ext . ubswenergy . com 192 . 216 . 57 . 100
dnsl - ext . ubswenergy . com 192 . 216 . 57 . 101
it is entirely possible that the names dnso - ext . ubswenergy . com
and dnsl - ext . ubswenergy . com will be rejected because the
ip addresses associated with those names are already associated with
dnso - ext . enrononline . com and dnsl - ext . enrononline . com . if this is
the case , it will be necessary to use the enrononline . com domain
names
for the dns servers and then change the server names later , once
ubswenergy is on - line and ready . as long as the servers provide
information about both domains , this should be possible .
