Subject: friday event
audrey is ok with the following plan . please let me know if you are too . . .
breakfast ( donuts , muffins , kolaches , coffee ) on both floors to welcome everyone in the morning .
happy hour celebration with the group .
i have looked into :
sambuca jazz cafe http : / / sambucahouston . citysearch . com / we can have the place to ourselves from 3 - 5 and we could move the party to the 2 nd floor after 5 : 00 . audrey would prefer that we keep it to a two drink minimum . they can have drink tickets available upon arrival . we can have a selection of appetizers available and we could also arrange to pay for valet parking . with a high estimate of 600 people here are the following cost estimates :
food , beverage , valet * , tax , and gratuity - $ 29 . 22 per person
same as above minus valet * - $ 27 . 22 per person
* valet was only for an estimate of 200 cars
i ' m ready to roll with the arrangements , and told audrey i would keep her in the loop regarding arrangements .
let me know !
regards ,
julie
