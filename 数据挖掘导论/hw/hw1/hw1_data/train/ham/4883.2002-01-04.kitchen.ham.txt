any interest in taking a look at this ? if it is clean and netco can get it for $ 0 . 50 on the dollar and if they dont need to close for several weeks , it might be worth having tycholiz look at it .

ees has been soliciting bids for some of its larger markets . ( ca , il , ny , oh , etc ) to date the bids have been dismal . we are down to one player looking at one market and they are bidding $ 0 . 30 on the dollar . ( $ us ) these deals are clean and could be managed fairly easily by netco . it might be a stretch , but this morning , management suggested we find out if netco can do some due dilligence at this time and determine if we want to bid on some of the book . i am available at ( 713 ) 345 4441 if someone wants to discuss .
