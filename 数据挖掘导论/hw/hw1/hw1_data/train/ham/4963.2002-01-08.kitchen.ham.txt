Subject: the maple leafs
i have been notified that td securities will be coming wednesday morning for due diligence on netco . they will arrive between 8 and 8 : 30 am with a team of 9 people and plan on being here through thursday night . i will be coordinating things for them on the corp dev side . please let me know who your commercial coordinator is and the schedule for the first day presentations .
the data room is currently located in ecn 3371 ; however we are trying to find a room that would be more accomodating for such a large group .
i will send you the names and titles of td ' s team as soon as i get it .
thanks ,
mari capestany
