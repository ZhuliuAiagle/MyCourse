vince ,
i am writing in regards to an energy derivatives training course i am
developing . i would like to invite you to be an instructor for the course .
a preliminary agenda is attached . brett humphreys from risk capital
management is teaching on day one , and i was wondering if you would be
interested in covering all or part of day two . the topics outlined here can
be modified based on your feedback .
our training courses are structured for an interactive , classroom - type
setting . we limit the audience to 25 people and bring in 2 - 3 instructors to
cover the material over the course of two days .
i will follow up but please let me know what you think .

thank you ,
