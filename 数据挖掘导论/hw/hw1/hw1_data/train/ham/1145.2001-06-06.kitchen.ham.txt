Subject: pbs : frontline ( 06 / 05 / 01 )
transcripts of lay ' s and skilling ' s interviews are available as well . pbs didn ' t have this scheduled on its program listing for houston last night , but from what i hear , everyone on the interview panel was grilled on the show ( skilling takes on a fairly aggressive stance ) .
hope both of you and scott are all doing well .
affectionate thoughts ,
