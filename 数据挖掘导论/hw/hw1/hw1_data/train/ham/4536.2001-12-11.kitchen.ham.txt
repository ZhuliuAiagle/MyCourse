consensus now is that all gas and power systems and ip for trading will be put in newco . enron will maintain all of its own systems and ip to support gas , power and all other commodoties . problem is this requires additional it people immediately and may require additional hardware . think 50 additional workers for 1 to 2 months and $ 2 to $ 5 million for hardware . alternative is to provide newco what it needs , get services back for gas and power and go dark on all remaining commodities ( coal , etc . ) .
