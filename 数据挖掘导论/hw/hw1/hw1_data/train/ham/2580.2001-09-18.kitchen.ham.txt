i believe john milar works for eric gadd . he has spoken with a couple of my guys about developing a lm 2500 at one of transwestern ' s compressor stations . despite what i told eric a couple of months ago , they seem to be moving forward . they have received pricing from eeos and asked bill williams in our tech services group to check the eeos numbers . i will look into it further and report back .
