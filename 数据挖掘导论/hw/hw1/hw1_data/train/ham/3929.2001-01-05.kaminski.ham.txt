hi vince :
number one below is fine . . . the more accurate the ebitda model the better .
your " tweaking " of the model at this point won ' t create any chinese wall
problems .
michelle and gary will talk about the programmer issue on monday , and get
back to you . i apologize if there was any confusion . we ' re certainly
grateful for alex ' s involvement .
today is my last day of associate rotation within the financial trading
group , and i start at ees on monday . i handed off the project as best i
could , and of course will be available if you need me . my e - mail and phone
number will be the same .
have a nice weekend .

subject : power plant model
jeff ,
a few comments on the model :
1 . we have a few reservations about some features of the model but would like
to
discuss it internally and make the improvements without giving the benefit of
our insights to the consultant .
in general , the model is not unreasonable but the devil is always in the
details and in the inputs and
calibration . the same model may produce drastically different results
depending
on the quality of inputs .
2 . we don ' t have a separate pool of programmers in the research group . we
were told that you
would provide an it resource . alex would supervise this person .
