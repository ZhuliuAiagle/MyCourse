Subject: dpc memo
vince ,
i am in houston ( rrived satruday ) , and will be in office on monday ( though
officially , i am on vacation ) . would like to catch up with you if possible .
it looks like your team will be getting involved in some form on the dpc
side . i have already made a recommendation to wade .
i am attaching a small memo that i have addressed to wade on the dpc position
and possible workout . this is still a draft and will likely get shared later
with others . i would love to get your comments on the same . at the same
time , this also will give you some idea of the problem , in conjunction with
the other plan presentation i had sent you .
look forward to touching base with you .
regards ,
sandeep .
