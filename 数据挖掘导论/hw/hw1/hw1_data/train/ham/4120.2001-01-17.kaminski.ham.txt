hi ,
thanks for the fed ex with the offer letter , and other pertinent
information about enron .
i have signed the letter and returned it to you , along with a couple of
other forms . you should receive these documents via fed ex on tomorrow
morning .
because i have to tie up a few loose ends here in california , i won ' t
be able to start until march lst . i hope that is okay .
thanks so much .
regards ,
iris
