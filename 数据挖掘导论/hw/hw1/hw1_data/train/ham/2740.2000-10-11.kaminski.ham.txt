subject : long term demand forecast - looking for more information
hi steve ,
i plan to spend next week building relatively simple long term ( 1 - 2 years )
demand forecast - it will be a starting point and will allow our guys to work .
for more detailed analysis i will need more information , particularly on
recent changes in demand in the sates ( california ) .
i tried to contact vince , but probably he is very busy right now .
please , could you help me to find somebody in the houston who may provide any
help .
many thanks ,
slava
