Subject: mike roberts
john ,
i have received your message regarding mike roberts . i could not
agree more . mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional
contribution .
additional recommendation . i think that all weather forecasting support
should be consolidated under mike ( including the weather guys supporting
power trading ) . in my view , it was a mistake to remove mike from
power support . it would also mean a lot to him personally .
