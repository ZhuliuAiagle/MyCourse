i will just be putting the date on to reflect when you will be going on maternity leave . do you have a date in mind yet ? from your point of view nothing will change .
i don ' t know if you have an equivalent form to the uk ' s mat bl which states your due date from your doctor ? if so could you forward that to me .
i attach the letter as it will be a lot quicker than post .
thanks
