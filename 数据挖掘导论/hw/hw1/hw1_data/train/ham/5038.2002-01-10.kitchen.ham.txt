upon approval by the new buyer of the pa and eta formats , we will contact our top 50 customers and send them copies of the final pa and eta forms with the new buyer ' s name filled in . during this week , we will be working hard to get as many of the pa ' s returned as possible . once we have an approved pa , we can send the customer their new user id , which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch " netcoonline " .
a splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name , on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www . enrononline . com . this page will tell customers about the pending launch of " netcoonline " and provide links to the pa and registration screens and also to the user admin screens , which will allow customer master users to start setting up their subusers .

general terms and conditions ( gtc ' s ) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity .
trading / origination coordination
we will shortly be sending you an invitation to join a meeting in which we will be discussing launch plans in more detail and looking for people to help in contacting customers on our top 50 list . although we have a dedicated enrononline marketing team , we would appreciate assistance from traders and originators who have strong relationships with our customers and can assist in getting signed pa ' s returned to us .
