- dave is incredibly valuable to our business .
- he lives in the most expensive city in the country .
- he has made enron $ 90 mm , most of which could not have closed if he lived in houston or portland .
- he is sitting on ( like the rest of us ) a lot of out of the money calls .
i think the following is appropriate :
base : $ 200 + $ 15 cola
signing : $ 100
equity : $ 300 ( 50 / 50 )
