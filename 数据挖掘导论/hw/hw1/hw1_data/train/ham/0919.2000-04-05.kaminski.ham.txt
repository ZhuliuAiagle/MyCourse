Subject: marketpoint business plan summary
vince :
thanks very much for your interest in our marketpoint product , and thanks
for the hour you gave me this morning . as promised , i am enclosing our
executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take
forward to your management as a prospective enron - marketpoint investment
collaboration . i want to reiterate that should enron elect to be the lead
investor here , you will be exclusive in your industry if you want . if enron
wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we
need , we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading
companies , pipelines , or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and
then only with your participation as a marketpoint board member . i am aware
you have coinvested with sap in the past and that you might want to coinvest
with them again . i presume you would not have a problem with
non - competitors such as epri , our management consulting service provider
partner , or our vc partner ( but i would want guidance from you in this
arena ) . i think you would find our vc partner very suitable and very
attractive . they have done several interesting energy and trading plays ,
and they would provide good management skills i believe . i hope we can move
forward together . i am looking forward to a positive response . thanks
again and best regards .

ps : you might hear from drew ries of your investments group . i spoke with
him after speaking with you about many of the same issues .
