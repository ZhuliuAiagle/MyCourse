celeste ,
as you may know , brad romine ' s dot . com venture fell apart .
the offer from enron looks much better now . i have arranged for him
a number of different interviews ( including one with you ) . i think we should
not be too
punitive and give him the 2 nd chance . i am setting up for him interviews with
rac ,
ebs and greg whalley and he should be able to negotiate a good first rotation .
please , give me a call if you have any other question .
