subject : re : clustering for power
jaesoo ,
as we discussed last week on wednesday meeting can you , please ,
implement clustering for power curves by geographical region . this involves the following :
1 . deciding together with risk control how many geographical regions we want to use
and which enron ' s curves belong to each region .
2 . deciding together with risk control how to choose core curves for each region . this decision can
be maid based on the a ) position size ; b ) statistical analysis . there might be other considerations .
3 . doing regression analysis for each curve versus the corresponding core curve .
winston ,
can is it possible to run var for the clustering results obtained by jaesoo with clustering done by sas ?
should we wait for the stage re - fresh and what is the status on this ?
