vince ,
kevin hannon is the executive lead for cornell and he needs to approve . i
am not sure if they have already interviewed on campus . he should go through
the on - campus screening process before attending a super saturday . we are
reserving the super saturday weekend for individuals that are highly likely
to receive an offer . i will forward this to kevin and kristin gandy .
although they are responsible for graduate recruiting at cornell , perhaps it
is possible for him to interview when they go on campus .
charlene
kevin and kristin ,
please see vince ' s message below . would it be possible for an undergraduate
to interview while you are at cornell ? please let me know .
thanks
