Subject: where do you stand on broker client ? as you can see below , some of the european desks are supportive of getting deals done , but i am leery of continuing broker client roll - out if there remains a chance that we will pull back from this offering in the near future . also , i ran into presto and he said he hadn ' t yet spoken to you about his issues with the product . let me know what your position is and we ' ll go from there .
thanks ,
brad

brad ,
it looks like i have taken back control of the tfs europe deal . i have received confirmation from each of the different desks that this is something they are willing to pursue . i went back to alan kurzer ( president of tfs ) with 300 , 000 euros ( about $ 265 k usd ) for continental power , uk power and int ' l . coal . he didn ' t bite so i told him to show me a bid . i ' ll let you know how it goes . i ' ve got a call into mark greenberg about the contractual issues . it should be something we can address in the amendment .
