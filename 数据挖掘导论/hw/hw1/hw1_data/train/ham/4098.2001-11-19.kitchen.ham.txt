tanya ,
i received a call from carr futures this morning . their parent , cr ? dit agricole indosuez , is requesting a parent guanantee to continue trading with enron north america corp . and enron capital and trade resources international .
i spoke with gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them . i said that others do trade with carr . he suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with carr .
rick farina , 312 - 441 - 4420 , called me with larry anderson and patty chambers .
how do you want to proceed ?
