julie ,
enron location makes more sense . no reason to pay for the hotel .
also , i think that one day makes more sense .
i contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training
course . i think that they would be interested if they got a good discount .

julie ,
that ' s definitely an option .
we can provide the room . maybe we can cut with you a special deal for enron
and increase the # of people attending . i am forwarding your message to
our weather desk .
vince
joe ,
what do you think about it ?

vince ,
we just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for the
weather derivatives course ( all from enron ) so far . we have a couple more
that have expressed strong interest , but we are awaiting their final
decision . if no one else signs up , chris and les thought that you guys
could probably get through the first day pretty easily , and thus thought it
may be an option to teach just the 2 nd day material ( pricing ) only at enron
( doing it at the hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the
large ? side ) ? we would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught . we
can teach both days as well , but thought you may want to save some time .
i just wanted to give you some time to think about it . we will know ? where
we stand on final numbers by next wednesday .
