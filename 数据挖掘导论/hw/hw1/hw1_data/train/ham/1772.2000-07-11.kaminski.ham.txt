Subject: resume of a former fx trader
i am forwarding the resume of wendell licon who works for enron
in the hr department ( executive compensation ) . he used to be an
fx trader . i am thinking about moving him to research when his current boss
is ready to release him .
i think , however , that you
should take a look at him as well and see if he fits your needs .
