team :
abb will be here on thursday , april 26 at 9 : 00 am . my recommendation is that ozzie and i start out with them and perhaps pull louise in at some point to show the flag . scott - we ' ll pull you in before we make any scheduling or engineering decisions - so if you could remain flexible for that period it would be greatly appreciated .
steph - if you could please get us a room through lunch at least . thanks .

drew ,
i spoke with svante this am and he and lars would like to visit with you and the
team on thursday 26 april 01 9 : 00 am . i think that they plan to fly in wed .
evening , i will pick them up at the airport and take them to dinner .
we will come to your offices to discuss where the project is at this time , where
enron expects it to go , what we can do to continue to support your efforts . we
will look at options that are beneficial to both enron and abb regarding
schedule , whatever that may be in the future considering work load for all
concerned . we will also will discuss some method ( even a handshake ) to keep the
contract in place so that we do not have to go through a negotiation next time .
please let us know if there are any other issues that you would like to discuss ,
we will be prepared . look forward to seeing you then .
mike
