Subject: exotica ( yet again )
hi guys
i need some advice .
sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions
of exotica . at some point we will need to migrate london office over to your
more up - to - date version , and i ' m concerned that there may be rac - style
implications . i ' m in favour of using the it testers to carry out formal
regression testing , and they are apparently able to do this .
do we need to get our heads together to " form a view " before we involve rac
or the business groups ?
anjam tells sharad that london exotica was built using excel 95 , and that
neither he nor zimin knows how to build / compile the xla using later versions
of excel . is this true ? if so , then we need to migrate to xlls sooner
rather than later because of the maintenance implications .
