Subject: ms 150
dear friends and family ,
on april 15 and 16 i will be joining thousands of riders and volunteers on
the ms 150 which is a two day bike tour from houston to austin covering 182
miles dedicated to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis .
multiple sclerosis is a disease that is total unpredictable . symptoms may be
mild such as numbness in the limbs , or severe paralysis or loss of vision .
most people with ms are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the
unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong
my wife , ilene was diagnosed with ms almost three years ago ; at first i was
at a loss of how i could support her . that was until i heard of the ms 150 ,
which is one of the greatest challenges of my life . it is my choice to
participate in the ms 150 , ilene does not have a choice , as she has to live
with ms every day .
this will be my third year riding in the ms 150 raising money for the
national ms society to fight multiple sclerosis . in 1998 my goal was simple .
it was to raise money and ride the 182 miles on my own . i succeeded in my
endeavor by completing the ride on my own steam and raising $ 6 , 000 . in 1999
i raised my goal to $ 10 , 000 and finished the tour . not only did i meet my
goal , but surpassed it by raising $ 15 , 000 to fight this devastating disease
with the help of my friends and family . this year my goal is even greater !
my wife and i are once again asking for your help . this year on the 2000 ms
150 bike tour , my goal is to raise $ 20 , 000 .
enron is a big supporter of the ms 150 . for the past two years we were the
largest bike team and biggest fundraiser of any corporate team nationally .
last year we raised $ 310 , 000 with 300 riders . enron will match dollar for
dollar on all contributions donated in my name . using this secure , fast and

sclerosis .
