as the objectives of the research group . i was impressed by the fast - paced
environment and dedication that were displayed by your group . it is apparent
to me that your group greatly contributes to the overall success of enron .

sure , tomorrow is fine with me . is it possible to schedule it at 3 : 30 pm ?
and i am sure it is not an easy task to fit the schedule of several people
to
be available at the same time window . so please feel free to let me know
if
you will need to do another time adjustment .

valeria :
please do not think we are always this unorganized , but things just seem
to be happening right now and it is disrupting everyone ' s schedule .
would you possibly be able to come tomorrow the 8 th ? kevin kindall
will not be here on the 15 th and he would definately like to interview you .
then vince kaminski will be gone for two weeks after the 15 th . it seems
like tomorrow might be the best time for everyone , if it is for you .
we can begin the interviews at 3 : 00 pm and probably end them at 5 : 00
or 5 : 30 pm .
please let me know .
thanks so much for your understanding .

definitely - any of these days sound good to me . the only concern that i
have , is that i have my graduate class on thursday night at 6 pm which is
september the 14 th .
so if you will schedule the interview on the 14 th of september , i would
need
to leave around 5 : 15 pm so i could attend my class .
it actually might be more convenient for me to meet with the interviewers
on
the 15 th of september . if this day does not fit the schedule of any of the
interested in interviewing individuals , i surely will be able to meet with
them on the 14 th .
i will be looking forward to your reply .
sincerely ,
valeria stone

valeria :
would you be able to do the interview on the 14 th or 15 th instead of the
13 th ? vince kaminski , who would really like to interview you , has been
called out of town on the 13 th . he will be back on the 14 th .
also grant masson is conducting an options seminar on the 13 th and
would not be able to interview you until after 5 : 00 pm .
please let me know if we can just push the interview to the same time
frame only on the 14 th or 15 th .
thanks !
