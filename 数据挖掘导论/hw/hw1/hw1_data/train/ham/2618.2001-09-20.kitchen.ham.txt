louise ,
i think the following is appropriate and i can get done :
dyer :
base - same
cash - $ 50
equity - $ 150
mcdonald :
base - same
cash - $ 75
equity - $ 200
parquet :
base - same
cash - $ 100
equity - $ 250
i know these are at the top end . for what it is worth , the other guys i got done this year were not at the top end because i did not believe it was necessary ( gilbert , page , etringer , thome , wehn ) .
if we can say done , the actual contract process can be slowed so that the equity is not set till the november meeting . also , if we get done , i wont bug you anymore !
