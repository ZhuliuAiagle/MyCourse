now , here ' s what we ' re going to do based on your feedback .
stock price
we are all concerned about our stock price , which has declined significantly this year . the primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include :
- - - a decline in the overall market and economy ;
- - - certain enron - specific issues , such as california , india and recent management turnover ;
- - - a " meltdown " in the broadband sector , which may have been as much as $ 30 - $ 40 of our stock price at the high ;
- - - lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter ' s high ; and
- - - concerns over the pace of energy deregulation .
these concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution , wholesale and retail businesses . very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth , and future earnings growth , as has enron . we fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors , our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve .
- - - over the past month , we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts , reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses .
- - - we have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money .
we also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward :
- - - mark koenig , executive vice president of investor relations , will host brown bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions . he will also continue to host espeak sessions to answer employee questions .
- - - greg whalley , mark frevert and i will also hold discussions with various groups of employees , which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide . watch for these events .
the prc
the relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy . understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors , which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership , and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives . nevertheless , we recognize that certain aspects of the prc may have caused some of you concern , and we believe we can improve , refine , streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone .
therefore , we will make the following changes to the prc process prior to year - end :
- - - effective immediately , relative performance discussions will occur annually at year - end . however , business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently .
- - - the current preferred distribution will no longer be required across enron . business units will be asked to identify only their top 10 % and bottom 10 % performers for review by enron ' s office of the chairman annually at year - end .
- - - we will continue to use the pep 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees . we will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year .
- - - finally , we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes .
in the november issue of enron business , we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process . in addition , there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year - end .
employee morale
we believe the stock price , our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale . additionally , some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns . effective immediately , we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their human resources ( hr ) rep .
- - - we are establishing a new business function we are calling employee relations ( er ) that will report directly to the office of the chairman . cindy olson will head this function . more details of how this group and hr will operate will be communicated in the next few days .
over the long term , we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles .
- - - we will encourage vice presidents and above , as well as other current and emerging leaders , to complete executive impact & influence training . these sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people .
- - - additionally , we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via communicate ! , which will be rolled out immediately . communicate ! is an interactive training course that uses enron scenarios and a combination of video , voice mails , e - mails and meetings notes , to analyze user performance based on a participant ' s responses and actions .
external reputation
we all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year . the single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees . we recognize that as enron ' s ambassador ' s in the marketplace , the more you know about our strategy , performance and challenges , the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company . to ensure you are better informed :
- - - we will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting enron . in addition to our existing communication efforts , like e - mail messages and internal publications ebiz and enron business , we will post a q & a on current issues on the enron intranet at home . enron . com . this will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers .
- - - as we said before , greg , mark and i , as well as members of our management committee , will meet with groups of employees across enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges . look for these to start in mid - october .
integrity & respect
i believe , as i said previously , we need to reinforce our core values , particularly integrity and respect . from what you have told us in this survey , you agree .
- - - enron ' s values will have more importance in each employee ' s evaluation and feedback . we ask that all employees , regardless of level , hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis . we are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers .
- - - we will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional , specific feedback on employee issues like ethics , integrity and individual concerns . if you would like to participate in these focus groups , please send an e - mail to cindy olson .
- - - periodically , i will host a special feature column in enron business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results .
finally , i give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding enron ' s strategy and challenges , and listening to your concerns and ideas . but we would ask for your commitment , too . we need your dedication to enron and its values , as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long - term success . we will conduct another employee survey early next year . please continue to send me your feedback and let ' s continue to work together and keep enron one of the best places to work in the world .
