Subject: real estate issues re : ubsw energy , llc in houston
hello pat , louise , dave
the ubsw real estate department is reviewing the current / future lease
terms for ubsw energy llc , in houston . according to brian dugan , our
lead real estate guy on the bank side , the building owner has offered
a nine month lease to stay in the south tower on the 5 th and 6 th
floors . after the nine months we will be offered the option to sign
up for an additional 18 months but we could be moved down to floors 3
and 4 . is this a significant issue ? i understand that the 3 rd and
4 th floor foot prints are similar to 5 / 6 .
if ubsw energy is willing to relocate to the north tower , they can
get a lease for 5 - 9 years but this tower may be less suitable . what
are the issues here ?
the integration real estate team plans to meet this afternoon with
the bank ' s outside legal firm we use for real estate issues . we have
a target date of this friday to try to resolve all real estate issues
in order to meet the day 0 legal integration date of 2 / 6 / 02 .
your thoughts please .
