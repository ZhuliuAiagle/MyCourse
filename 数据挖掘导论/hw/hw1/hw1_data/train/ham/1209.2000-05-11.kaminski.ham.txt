Subject: steve ' s trip to houston
dale , richard ,
i am ready to cover the cost of steve ' s trip to houston ( one month in the
summer ) .
i think very highly of steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his
horizons . i see him as a very valuable asset of enron and a great leader
in not too distant future . he needs exposure to more diverse business
problems and areas of research . i think it will be in the best interest of
the company
to devote some resources to foster his development .
