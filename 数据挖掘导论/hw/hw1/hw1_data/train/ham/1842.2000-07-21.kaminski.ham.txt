Subject: re : manabu matsumoto
hi lucy / natalie
given that manabu is perceived as the " specialist " type , and probably
shouldn ' t go straight into the gas trading group , this may have implications
for research headcount if he ' s considered a good non - a & a hire .
i ' ll be spending the next couple of weeks canvassing opinions from various
vps and mds over their preferred size , role and style of research group for
europe . i think we should delay manabu ' s second round interviews for a while .
cheers ,
steve

steve ,
i am out of the office tomorrow and was just wondering if you ' d had a chance
to think about the interview list for manabu ?
if you get a list together , natalie will be able start working on it -
alternatively i will catch up with you on monday .
natalie - just so you know manabu will be coming in for second round but not
for the a & a programme - probably a specialist in steve ' s group ( we ' ll pass it
over to commercial support next week )
cheers
lucy
