van ,
it ' s nice to hear from you . i am sure that you can always come back
to enron if you don ' t like living in new york .
i used to work for salomon and chances are you will be working in the same
building in lower manhattan where i spent 7 years of my life .
i hope you have a great holiday season .

subject : greetings
dear vince :
i just wanted to get in touch with you , as my last fall semester here
draws to a close and this is something of a transition point for me . to
update you on my job search , i have been extended an offer for a position
within enron ' s analyst program . the offer was very attractive and i had
numerous things to consider in reaching my decision . unfortunately , i
will be declining enron ' s offer of employment to take a position in the
investment banking division of salomon smith barney in new york . my
preference at this point is to live outside of houston , and although my
hope is also to return to houston in future , new york offers some
exciting options for me now . i will be starting there in july of this
summer . i hope that i will have future opportunities to be an advocate
of enron and look forward to keeping in touch with you and the research
group .
please give my regards to everyone at the office and wishes for a very
happy holiday season ! also please feel free to contact me at any time .
i can give you my future contact information when i have it .
thank you and i hope i ' ll see you again .
sincerely ,
van
p . s . feel free to forward my news onto mike roberts if that would
appropriate . i didn ' t have his email with me .
