dave ,
given how the audience might interpret this in light of recent events , do we really want to be sending a letter to customers boasting of enron conducting its affairs in accordance with the " highest ethical standards " ?

we appreciate your efforts in contributing to an enron work environment of which we can all be proud .

dear sir or madam :
enron corp . ( " enron " ) believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards . as outlined in enron ' s code of ethics , employees of enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with enron ' s business ethics policy which requires an employee to conduct himself / herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his / her employment with enron . further , enron ' s business ethics policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by enron employees for special position , price , or privilege .
not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy , but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical . enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with enron . enron ' s auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom enron does business . your recognition of our ethical standards allows enron employees to work with you via arm ' s length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations . if you ever become aware of variances from our policy , please advise :
>
your business relationship is important to us , and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you .
very truly yours ,
