Subject: netco - draft launch employee communication
my current understanding is an anticipated close of february 8 th ( friday ) .
there are a number of matters we will need to communicate to employees between now and then . while we may decide that consolidating these matters into a single communication is not practical / desirable , i would like to make sure that all employee communications are co - ordinated . below is an initial list of the general matters that we have currently identified as needing to be addressed with my understanding of who is taking the lead :
