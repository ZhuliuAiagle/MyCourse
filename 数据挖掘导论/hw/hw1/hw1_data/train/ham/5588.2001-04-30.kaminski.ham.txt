vince ,
just wanted to check with you to see if you have a preference as to when you
would like to have your mid - year prc meeting . if you and your team are
available , i would prefer to have it on either june 12 th , 13 th or 14 th . i am
very flexible though , so please just let me know so that i can start making
the necessary accommodations .
thanks ,
anne
