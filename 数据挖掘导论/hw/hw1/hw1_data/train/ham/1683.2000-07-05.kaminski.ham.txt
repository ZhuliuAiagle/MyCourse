deal all ,
i have written the option pricing formula for european ( euro ) , american
( amer ) and asian ( agc ) options .
i have also cited the references for each option . the function names in ( )
are the option models in the
enron exotica options library . you do not have to have outside programmer
to duplicate our work , since we have
constructed and tested these models .
if you have any questions , please let me know .

thanks for your help on content for eol phase 2 .
an additional piece of content that we are trying to include in our scope is
an options calculator . this would be an interactive tool to teach less
sophisticated counterparties about options . we would like to collaborate
with someone in research to refine our approach ( and make sure we ' re using
the right formulas ) . who should we contact in research for this ?
attached is a mock - up of what we have in mind . . .
