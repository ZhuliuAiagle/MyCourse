it ' s fine with me . i think the expense is justified ( as it ' s equal to the
cost of the alternative ) .

fyi , i may have to stay over weekend . vince , if that is the case , i may have
to bring my wife or allow her to go to her sister for a week etc . i may ask
john to cover some of that cost as ( i think ) he is done with other people .
i ' ve seen other guys family members showup . this cost would equal what ebs
would have spend to send me home and bring me back again , etc .
ravi .
