Subject: london research group
john ,
i am writing to you regarding the management of the london research group .
as you know , dale surbey , who was managing the london unit of the research
group ,
is moving to ebs . dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of
talent we have currently
in london .
given that dale is likely to be transfered to houston , it ' s time
to nominate one member of the research group for a management position .
my recommendation is steve leppard . steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group but also as a natural leader ,
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers . steve has a very high energy
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as coach of new talent .
his promotion is likely to cause anjam ' s departure form enron . i value
technical
skills of anjam , but in spite of my loyalty to him , don ' t think he is the
same caliber
as steve . however , i would not like to lose him and think about moving him to
houston
for 2 years . i think that the opportunity to work in houston , would be a
sufficient
incentive to keep him in enron . by the way , his performance feedback has
greatly improved .
please , let me know what you think .
