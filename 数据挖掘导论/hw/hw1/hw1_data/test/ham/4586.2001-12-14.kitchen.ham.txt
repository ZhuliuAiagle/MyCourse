here is the revised draft reflecting comments from enron management team
and enron legal team ( houston ) .
for some reason , i am unable to run comparite remotely . if someone located
in nyo could run a comparison between version 3 and version 6 and
distribute to this same list it will aid people in the review . thanks .
