Subject: re : ecc new grads
issue is headcount approval . in the next 6 months i ' m not sure we can commit to any increase , although if we get a flying start in canada it is possible . while i think we can explore whether ubs are interested elsewhere , my feeling is that we can ' t commit to anything at this stage . if things are different in july them maybe we can reconsider if they haven ' t found something elsewhere .

subject : ecc new grads
david , we made offers to 4 new grads a few months ago to work for enron canada corp . ecc is obviously going to renege on these offers . is there any opportunity to have these offers assigned to ubs warburg energy . all four of these new grads are outstanding and the timing should be aligned with business ramping up ( ie june - sept timeframe ) . the estate would be cooperative with assigning the offers and the students are looking for clarity / comfort .
