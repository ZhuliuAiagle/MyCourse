subject : talked to bryson
fyi . i ran into bryson last friday . he told me ( insisted , in fact ) that edison was paying everyone in february . he told me ( insisted , again ) that they would have all necessary approvals from the puc in the next several weeks . he said that once those approvals are in place , they ' ll quickly get financing in place to ensure a february payment date - - for everyone . i said that was great news but that the market didn ' t seem quite as certain . he was pretty firm . he also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily , that a judge wouldn ' t go for it .
did you know if lay every talk to bryson ?
best ,
jeff
