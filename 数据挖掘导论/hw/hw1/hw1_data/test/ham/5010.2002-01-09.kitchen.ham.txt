Subject: umbrella - netco employee salaries on possible transfer
john ,
as discussed , we propose a 3 % adjustment to the base salaries of the under $ 100 k employees to be included in the netco offer letters we may produce next week ( this is separate from any promotions we may want to make - we will give you a list by friday pm ) . i have spoken with john and louise and they are in agreement . following our last conversation i believed you also were in agreement . please confirm .
the salary increase will not be communicated as a subsidy for additional benefits costs , but as a modified / streamlined annual base salary review which we would do at this time of year , in the normal course of business .

subject : final cost estimates for ssmb benefit transition
attached below is the final estimates for ssmb :
based on a worst case scenario if all ad & d , employee life and spouse life insurances were maxed out it will take $ 1 . 9 million additional dollars to make every employee whole ( 3 % over our current annual payroll ) .
if we only look at employee ' s who make less than $ 100 k a year we would need $ 1 . 2 million additional dollars . ( worst case scenario )
included are all the estimates , rate charts , and salary adjustments .
thanks , tony
