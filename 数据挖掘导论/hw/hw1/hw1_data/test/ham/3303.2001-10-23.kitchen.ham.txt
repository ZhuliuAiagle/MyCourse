currently , we have been working to finalize the accuracy of the data in that report . john has been given access to the report to initially provide feedback on the format . we have not given access to greg whalley or rick buy either , as we wanted to be sure of the accuracy of the data . we can go ahead and give you access now if you would like , and we will let you know when the report is final . ( within a week )
please let me know if there are any other reports you need access to .
thanks ,
