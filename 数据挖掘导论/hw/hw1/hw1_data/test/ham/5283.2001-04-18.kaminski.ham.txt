karin ,
i talked to mike roberts ( the head of the whole weather team ) , and he is
saying that all expenses for tony should be charged to global products team .
this is agreed between vince and jeff shankman .
mike and vince are negotiating with john to put stephen ( or somebody who will
replace him ) to some other cost centres ( via research ) .
it looks like kevin moore is happy if stephen is charged to the same cost
centre as tony .
let us right now charge tony and stephen to the cost centre below .
please , could we charge them separately - when john and vince make their
decision , we should be able to re - charge .
many thanks ,

stephen , all charges for soft ware that you use in london
should be charged to the same cost center as tony hamilton ,
reason being , is that someone will replace you in that position .

hi karin . . .
i hope you had a splendid holiday ! i wanted to thank you for getting tony
and i set up here last week . we seem to have established a steady daily
routine and are supporting several different trading groups in london as well
as continuing our daily support of traders in houston . we ' ve gotten far more
requests for information than we expected , so as a result i will be remaining
in london a little longer than originally expected . as of now - i ' m not sure
exactly when i ' ll be going back to houston - but vince has let me know that i
will remain here as long as necessary to ensure adequate daily weather
support for the london traders .
to that end - i think i will need one additional piece of software installed
on the machine that i will be using on a regular basis . could i please get
microsoft frontpage installed as soon as we can get it ?
that leads to the second issue of desks . i know that space is a premium here
- and i understand that i may need to move around some as a result . i
certainly want keep things as simple as possible for everyone - but i also
wanted to make sure that you know that there are certain applications that
are essential for the daily trader support in london and houston . as such ,
if i move , we will need to make sure that these applications are available
from the beginning of the day ( we start about 0600 ) . the applications are :
1 ) adobe acrobat - full version
2 ) accuweather for windows - ( this is something i will need to install )
3 ) microsoft front page
4 ) terminal server
5 ) the full ms office software package
one idea would be to have a pc move with me - that way we would not need to
reinstall this software which could cause problems with the daily support
routine .
thanks again for all of your help . i will let you know - once i know - how
long i will be here . i should hear something from vince over the next few
days giving me an idea .
cheers ,
steve
