" cotton mary " sounds good . it ' s a film by ismail merchant who collaborated
on " a room with a view " , " howard ' s view " , and other well known movies .
it ' s a story about two anglo - indian sisters .

vince ,
the angelika has several movies that would be good . i am familiar with all
but one - - " cotton mary . " do you know anything about it ?
if you still haven ' t seen " american beauty " , that is fine with us . just let
me know what sounds good to you . we are flexible when it comes to movies .
