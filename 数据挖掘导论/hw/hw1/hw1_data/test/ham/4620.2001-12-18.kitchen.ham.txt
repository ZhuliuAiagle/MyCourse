Subject: organizational announcement
as things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week , we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently .
organizational matters
the creditors ' committee was formed last week by the united states trustee . this committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including : banks , bondholders , insurance companies and employees . the creditors ' committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from chapter 11 . initially , they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections . ultimately , they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain .
from an enron perspective , the plans for reorganization have already begun . overhead has been reduced dramatically , certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed . we hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future . furthermore , detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week . this will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from chapter 11 as a healthy company .
by now , you must have heard of " netco . " this company was formed as a means to maximize the value of enron ' s most valuable business , the wholesale energy business . certain enron north america employees have been assigned to netco to re - build the north american gas and power business under different ownership . we will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for netco . it is our expectation that enron would retain a 49 percent ( or perhaps less ) non - controlling interest in netco . the netco employees would become employees of the winning bidder . we anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in january .
as for the remaining businesses of enron , they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention . this review process will take time as it will require approval of the creditors ' committee . we will update you periodically on our process .
personnel matters
as a result of our current situation , we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization .
