Subject: re : high yield portfolio hedging
bill , why don ' t you and i get together to discuss the proposal . as you know , we are intending to transfer credit risk through the project x , y and z structures but not likely the most riskier of credits . all of the structures rely on cdo and synthetic cdo structures . in addition , we have received indications of interest on non - funded risk transfer structures , pure first loss transfer , that may be interesting to review .

hope alls well and you ' re enjoying life in houston . one of the projects my group ( enron credit - syndication ) , are currently working on is to try and originate , structure and place a high yield and / or emerging market cdo , which is made up of both enron risks and externally originated risks . the plan would be to provide a cost effective way for enron to hedge its credit exposure to riskier counterparties . i am not sure if enron north america has any of this type of exposure , but would be interested to talk to someone and find out if there is any way that we might be able to help your group . i attach a short presentation which outlines the rationale for what we are doing .
