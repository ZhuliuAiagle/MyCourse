joe ,
we are looking at this again . there seem to be even bigger issues than accounting with the regional erc ' s , such as limited liquidity and trading volumes , extremely long transfer times for the local issuing authority to change title , etc . then , of course , barclay ' s has to agree to take them . we will push hard internally to get them in ; then start working on barclays when we have a strong story . i am not optimistic , but i do feel the pressure that you are under . shankman and mcconnell called me in to tell me what you told me last week - get all inventory off asap . i recommend that we nail down the so 2 extension before pushing barclays on other products . is that ok with you ?
jim
