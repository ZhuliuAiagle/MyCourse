Subject: benchmarking study
sally ,
i gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request .
they renewed their request for enron ' s participation .
what is your view on this ? do you think the benefits of knowing what ' s
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the
project .
my recommendation is to forget it .

subject : benchmarking study
dear vince ,
peter nance and i wanted to follow - up our discussion of enron ' s participation
in our benchmarking study . have you discussed enron ' s participation in the
project with your colleagues ?
here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive
list of over 700 metrics . the study group will decide which metrics to use .
with eei ' s credibility and teknecon ' s technical expertise , we intend to
become the industry standard in benchmarking . we would very much like to
have enron participate in the study .
i would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with
peter nance if you think that would be helpful .
best regards ,
