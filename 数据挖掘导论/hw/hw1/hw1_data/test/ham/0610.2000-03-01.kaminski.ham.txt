Subject: job application
dear dr . kaminski ,
i currently hold a post - doctorate position in the mathematics
department at the university of texas at austin ( with a ph . d .
in theoretical physics ) . although my position here is renewable
until summer 2001 , i would like to move on to a more dynamic field
where i can still use my analytical skills and mathematical knowledge .
since attending a series of lectures on mathematical finance given
by dr . marc potters last summer i started studying the subject on my
own and found it intriguing and challenging .
i am interested in a position in your group ( rac ) at enron .
last fall in a career seminar at ut you mentioned that people who are
interested can send you their resume . if this is still relevant , please
find below my resume ( in word 97 and text formats ) .
thank you for your time .
yours ,
