Subject: re : invitation - whartonetevent - apr 20 / plsrsvp
vince and chistie ,
sorry you won ' t be attending our april 20 et event , but of course we realize that many of our partners can ' t attend every event .
with this in mind , we put conference reports online in a " quick read " format for busy executives . our site is located at : http : / / emertech . wharton . upenn . edu - we ' ll be adding new reports in the coming 2 weeks .
i would also ask , is there anyone else at enron involved in mergers and acquisitions who would benefit from the april 20 event ? this will be one of our most " content - rich " events - reporting on surveys on high tech acquisitions as well as best practices in successful mergers and partnerships . please feel free to pass on the invitation to colleagues at enron who you feel might find this worthwhile , or you can give me email addresses if you ' d like me to extend the invitation with the most recent agenda .
we very much appreciate enron ' s support of the et program and look forward to your participation in the future .
best regards ,
michael
