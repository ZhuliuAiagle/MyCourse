subject : weather article - photos ?
dear joseph ,
thank you so much for sending me such an interesting article on the internet
and weather derivatives . i really enjoyed reading it !
i just have one final question - do you have a photograph of yourself ( or
the other authors ) that you could send me ? tif , gif or jpeg files are fine
so long as they are 300 dpi .
thanks again and i hope to hear from you soon .
best regards ,
jane
