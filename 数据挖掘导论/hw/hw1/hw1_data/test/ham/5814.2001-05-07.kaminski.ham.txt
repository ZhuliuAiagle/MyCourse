vince ,
i have ? left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally .
my brother ? vikas , who is now in london , is trying to make a switch from
consulting world to ? working for a specific firm . over last few months , i
have heard of great deal ? about the success of enron on line business which
fits well in the area of his ? expertise . i am wondering if you know of some
one in london who he can speak to ? regarding career opportunities .
since ? i spoke to you last , a number of things have changed . recently , my
manadate was ? broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk
management function ? for both the domestic and international businesses for
gmac . needless to say , ? this is exciting albeit making the life a little
more hectic than ? usual .
talk ? to you later .
