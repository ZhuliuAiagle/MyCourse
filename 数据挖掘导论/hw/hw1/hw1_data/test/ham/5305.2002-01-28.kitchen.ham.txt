Subject: couple of things
is it okay if i get jesse ( our clerk ) to pack your files ? i want to confirm what you wanted packed . all files except your eol files . does this mean all binders in bookcases as well in your cabinets ?
is it okay to tell people that are calling for you that you are in london ? i told pat o ' donnell you were in london but reachable .
also , do you want someone to sit in for me while i ' m out ? i talked to liz and she thought she would be fine but i wanted to check with you .
