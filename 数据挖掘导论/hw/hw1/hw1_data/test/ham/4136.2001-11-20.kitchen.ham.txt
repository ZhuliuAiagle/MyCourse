ees is fine with the org . chart below . i understand the $ 6 . 4 million is total for both ena & ees . comments :
1 . ) need a recommended split of the $ 6 . 4 million for ena / ees .
2 . ) i understand the $ 6 . 4 million includes $ 0 for outside services . the ooc of ena / ees needs to approve as these services are needed .
3 . ) the $ 6 . 4 million does include legacy real estate costs . jim fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs - is this on his radar screen ?
4 . ) we need to reconcile what we do with steve montovano . because both ena / ees want to utilize him , i might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him . louise / jim - are you both ok with this ? if so , rick / jim , i would suggest putting him in the ne gas box .
5 . ) rick , i understand you ' re talking with kean / whalley on handling the washington office activity in corp . i agree .

here is the org chart that captures our discussions . i think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ena and ees .
total headcount = 21 . the personnel cost = $ 6 . 4 mm ( total for ena and ees ) .
please let me know if you have any questions .
