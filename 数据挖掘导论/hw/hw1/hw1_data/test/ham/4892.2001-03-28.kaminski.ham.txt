Subject: school teaching
hello vince ,
i stopped by to see you today 03 / 28 / 01 . however , mrs . shirley notified me
that you were out of the country . look , i need another favor . my wife , whom
you met last summer , and i have been living in the woodlands about a month
now . we have tried , to no avail , to get her in the local school district as
a speech pathologist or a k - 6 grade school teacher . she could easily find a
teaching job in the houston independent school district . however , i would
prefer that she taught locally , in the woodlands . i need to know if you know
of anyone we can contact to get her in the woodlands school system . i would
greatly appreciate if you could help us out once again . i am attaching her
resume ' for your perusal . thanks a million vince ! ! !
sincerely ,
datren williams
