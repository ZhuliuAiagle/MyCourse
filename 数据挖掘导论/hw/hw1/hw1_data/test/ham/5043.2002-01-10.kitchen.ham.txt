Subject: power gtc
louise :
attached please find the gtcs for power ( with and without credit ) . please note that we are actually using the eei master agreement as the on - line contract , as opposed to the traditional gtcs . we were actually in the process of making this transition on eol this fall , and kevin presto and tim belden have endorsed netco ' s use of the eei on - line .
please let me know if you have any questions or comments .
