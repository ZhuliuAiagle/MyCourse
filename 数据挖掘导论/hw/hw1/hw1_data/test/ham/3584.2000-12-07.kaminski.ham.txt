subject : corporate allocation from enron research group
krishna ,
attached is a spreadsheet with the figures we discussed earlier . for
july - dec , ets will keep half of the amount allocated ( equivalent to 1 . 5
employees , $ 135 . 6 ) from the corporate allocations to ets . if this looks ok
to you , i would like to have vera work with shirley to handle the accounting
adjustment similar to mid year . many thanks , kim .
vera ,
here is the year 2000 spreadsheet . as you will see , we will need to work
with shirley crenshaw ( x 35290 ) with enron research group to coordinate a
similar accounting adjustment to the one we made mid year . i will send the
year 2001 budgeted spreadsheet to you in the next few days ( just in case it
changes with the approval of the science workorder ) . please call me if you
have any questions about this spreadsheet . thanks , kim .
