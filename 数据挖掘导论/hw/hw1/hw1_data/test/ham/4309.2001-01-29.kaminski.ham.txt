subject : re : visit to houston
stinson ,
just a quick note to let you know that i am looking into it ,
trying to rearrange a couple of things . i ' d like giuseppe and
possibly eric to come with me , so i need to coordinate with
them too . we ' ve made some nice progress that i ' d like to present
and also integrate eric in the system .
i am targeting a friday around the end of february or begining
of march . i ' ll let you know soon of a few possibilities as they
stabilize here .
best ,
nick
