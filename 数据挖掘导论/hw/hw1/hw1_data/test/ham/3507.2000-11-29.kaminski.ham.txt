subject : interest in a position
dear vince ,
when we talked last , you mentioned you were considering making additions to
your office staff . if you are still considering these additions , i would
like to talk to you and see if there might be a place for me . it would be
wonderful to work with a group such as yours .
it has been great working in recruiting , but the time has come for me to try
something else . i am beginning to look around , but wanted to talk to you
first . if my skill sets match a position you might be adding , please
consider me . i have attached my resume so that you will have an idea of what
i have done .
thank you for your consideration . have a great thanksgiving !
