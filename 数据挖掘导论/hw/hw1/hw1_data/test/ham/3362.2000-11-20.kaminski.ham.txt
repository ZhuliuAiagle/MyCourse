subject : pserc iab - who we are
one of the things i would like to accomplish over the next few weeks is for
we iab members to build a better working relationship . there have been many
changes to pserc over the past year , as well as many new iab members
joining with their universities . i ' ve felt that i don ' t know most of the
iab members and that makes it difficult for me to feel like i ' m adequately
representing your needs to the pserc executive committee . i hope to meet
many of you in denver and get to know you better , but i think we all need
to know each other better . i have an idea that might help us and it will
only take five minutes of your time .
if you could take the time to fill out the following short questionnaire
and email it back to me then i ' ll compile a list and distribute it to you .
depending upon when you respond i might be able to hand it out in denver ,
but i ' ll be sure to email you a copy later if i have to . this is , of
course , perfectly voluntary , so if you ' re not interested its okay . if you
want to respond via a telephone call , i ' m at 607 - 762 - 8825 .
email this back to me at sjdemarco @ nyseg . com and copy dennis ray at
djray @ engr . wisc . edu .
thank you very much , steve de marco ( iab chair )
