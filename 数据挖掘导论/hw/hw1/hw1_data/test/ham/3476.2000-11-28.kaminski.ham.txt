vince :
it was stewart myers , head of the financial engineering track . he did not
contact me directly , he contacted josef ( an mit student that spent the summer
with enron and received an offer to come to work with us ) .
josef wanted to know who could make the commitment of sponsoring ( sending the
problem ) .

subject : mit financial engineering pro - seminar
vince ,
i have received a call from mit asking if enron would be interested in
sponsoring a financial engineering pro - seminar .
this means that enron would propose a problem that would have its solution
developed by students in the financial engineering track . these students
would present the findings in the end .
i think that enron has already sponsored a financial engineering pro - seminar .
i remember something about real options at the time i was at school .
please , let me know if enron has the interest , specifically the research .
talking here at the weather desk , mark tawney expressed interest . if you
agree , we ( the weather desk ) could co - sponsor this pro - seminar with the
research . the idea , then , would be to propose a problem connected to weather
trading .
please , give me your thoughts about this issue .
thanks ,
claudio
