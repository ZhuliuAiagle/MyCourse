mark mentioned you had called regarding enrononline comments . here is the currently approved enrononline statement :
for the past two years , enron has used 30 - day rolling averages for daily transaction counts and notional value for our wholesale trading activities on enrononline due to the normal variability in these numbers on a day - to - day basis . due to the unusual events of the last few weeks , we provided some daily information . however , we intend to again use rolling averages in all communications going forward . while we saw some decrease in volumes on enrononline at the end of last week due to the impending merger announcement , volumes have returned to a normal range and are holding steady at a rolling average of more than 5 , 700 transactions with a notional value exceeding $ 2 . 7 billion .
does this meet with your approval ? in light of the merger , we are getting away from the daily regurgitation of numbers and back to our former policy .
