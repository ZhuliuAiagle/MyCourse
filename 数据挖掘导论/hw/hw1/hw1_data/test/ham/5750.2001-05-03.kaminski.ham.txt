Subject: risk desk , issue # 1
hello - - listen , wanted to make sure you received a copy of our newest publication last week , the risk desk . because of the size of the files we sent out , quite a few bounced back because some corp firewalls halt emails over a certain size . anyhow , if you didn ' t receive the issue , hit the reply button and type " resend risk desk . " responce so far has been great for those of you that received the free copy - - we think you ' ll agree that it ' s soon to become the leading " must read " publication on market , credit , price and operational risk management in the energy space .
also , just a reminder , the charter price for a one year subscription ( $ 199 ) ends soon . let us know .
