Subject: impending visit
vince :
i sent you an email a couple of days ago to inquire if we might get together
at your offices on july 5 or july 7 in houston to follow up our earlier
discussions . i notice i have two email addresses for you , so i am sending
this to both . i am not sure the earlier transmission got to you .
would you be available the afternoon of the 5 th or the morning of the 7 th to
continue our earlier discussions ? give me an email or phone shout at
650 . 218 . 3069 .
