Subject: longview dash
louise ,
a dash should hit your desk tomorrow . we are requesting an additional $ 9 mm to increase our exposure to $ 25 mm . this will cover us through 10 / 31 which should give us enough time to close the sale . the exposure is as follows :
ge gas turbine : $ 10 . 2 mm
alstom steam $ 7 . 0 mm
nooter / eriksen hrsg : $ 2 . 5 mm
engineering : $ 2 . 2 mm
gas interconnect : $ 0 . 9 mm
soft costs / idc : $ 2 . 7 mm
the development in general has gone very well . we believe that the remaining development risk is low and manageable . the info memorandum has lots of details . the preliminary , non - binding , indicative notional bids are as follows :
nrg : $ 25 - $ 30 mm
mccook : $ 20 mm
calpine : $ 18 mm
ppl global : $ 15 mm
aes : $ 11 mm
el paso : $ 10 mm
sempra : $ 3 mm
williams and allegheny showed us tolling bids . williams was below our desk mid ( $ 5 . 50 / kwmonth ) ; allegheny was not economic for our asset , but above our desk mid ( $ 8 . 25 / kwmonth ) . we are countering to both with desk offers .
nothing yet out of duke or dynegy , but they say they are working on it . everybody else is out ( mirant , constellation , entergy , fpl , pg & e , orion , pseg , tractabel ) .
i am obviously available at your convenience to discuss .
regards ,
