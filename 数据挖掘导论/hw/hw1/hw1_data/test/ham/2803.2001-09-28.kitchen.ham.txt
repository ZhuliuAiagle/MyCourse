we executed the purchase and sale agreement today . closing should occur in late october / early november and is subject only to bank and partner consents . bank consent will require nrg getting a legal opinion on nrg ' s ability to close without violating qf status ( we believe this is a non - issue but will require some handholding ) . our internal and sale proceeds will be approx $ 20 . 793 mm split between jedi and ena .
