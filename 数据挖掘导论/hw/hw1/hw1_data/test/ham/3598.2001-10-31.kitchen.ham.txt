merchant platforms for buying and selling energy to match assets to
customer loads ; and ( 3 ) solution sites for serving wholesale customers .
this boom in online energy trading has provided a golden opportunity
for bangalore - based orbit - e , a consultancy start - up promoted last year
by mr . rahul chawla , former ceo of the indian arm of cambridge
technology partners . orbit - e was initially set up to provide consultancy
and devising solutions for trading in financial securities . mr . chawla
believed that the experience of orbit - e in working with dealers in
financial securities could be leveraged to working with energy
traders . to boost its standing in the energy trading area , orbit - e has
taken on as a managing partner , mr . j . kevin mcconville , who was
managing director of enron north america between 1998 and 2000 . enron ,
according to the forrester report , redefined online energy trading in
2000 , accounting for $ 336 million of the total $ 400 million value
traded . by the end of the year , enron ' s marketmakers conducted 74 per
cent of their trades through enrononline , rather than closing deals over
the phone .
orbit - e , which has now around 90 persons on board , secured its first
round of venture funding from warburg pincus in october last year .
pointing out that the financing came at a time when venture funds were
fighting shy of the it industry , mr . chawla claimed that this was an
indication of the sound prospects for the company due to the niche areas
it had selected .
at a time when toplines in this industry are contracting , orbit - e
expects to cross a turnover of rs . 20 crores in the current year , up
from rs . 8 crores last year .
