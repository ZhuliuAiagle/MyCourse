louise ,
i am working on refining the list and obtaining more detail . when you say " names " , do you want names of companies , names of ena reps or names of people at the companies ?

not really enough detail on specific areas where they are crossing territory .
we know they are talking to munis but are they talking to utilities ? we need names etc .
split the list into areas
industrials in our sic codes
utilities
munis
thanks

louise ,
attached is the list i have collected so far . please let me know if this is what you need .
i think the attached substantiates two issues :
1 ) ees is approaching utilities and other wholesale entities ( and they are being quite up - front about this )
2 ) ees is approaching industrials which fall within ena sic codes .
