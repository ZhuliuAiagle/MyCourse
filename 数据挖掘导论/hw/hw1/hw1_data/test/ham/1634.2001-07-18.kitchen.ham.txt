Subject: follow up on transport pv quantities
the following table summarizes the pv quantities associated with the three transportation contracts owned by the navy yard . you may use this number to look at the impact of a 1 cent change in demand rates ( unitized ) on the value of the transaction . because pipeline demand charges do not flow as part of the sales price , an increase in the demand charge will result in a loss to the deal .
as a reminder , the base valuation makes very reasonable ( and conservative ) assumptions regarding increases in pipeline demand charges over the term of the deal .
