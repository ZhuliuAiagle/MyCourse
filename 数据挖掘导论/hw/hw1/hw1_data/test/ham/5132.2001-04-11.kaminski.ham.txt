hi everyone ,
i have run the model and , along with the contract briefs i have some questions the number of trials , numerical roundoff , and random number generator randomness statistical properties . the first two are not a problem in this application but the last one could be . has anyone examined the effect of using different random number generators on enron ' s aggregate credit risk ?
7 ) there is one last point here . for most of the above points , the " improved " analysis could make the credit risk be higher .
