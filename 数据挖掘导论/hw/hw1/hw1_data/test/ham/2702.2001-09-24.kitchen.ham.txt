liz ,
i work for anthony dayao as part of the ees it group but formerly was in enron net works under steve stock and met louise briefly in 1999 . i ' m in the middle of the rice university executive mba program and for one of our final exam questions , we are permitted to consult internal resources . the question is regarding how we ( enron ) have used the internet to differentiate ourselves from other organizations ( competitors ) in the industry . during our rice mba classes , eol was brought up several times so it ' s considered very highly by the school . i would be remiss if i didn ' t mention its strengths during our exam .
my professor has provided me assurance in writing ( email ) that any answer will not be published .
i appreciate louise ' and your time in helping me on this school exam paper .
regards ,
david zaccour
