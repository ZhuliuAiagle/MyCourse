hi louise ,
i am hearing that you and rob discussed the canada svc agreement and settled on a number in the ballpark of $ 7 m , which is comparable to last year . there is one change from last year that we may want to consider - the treatment of the regulatory affairs activity charged from corporate . last year rob was not burdened with this cost . this year we discussed pushing these costs to the appropriate commercial teams . please review the two attachments below and advise . currently our proposed service agreement amount totals $ 10 m .

the public affairs amount included in the agreement currently is $ 2 , 156 , 000 . see attached schedule for calculation . in the prior year , we did not include an amount for public affairs in the agreement .

i spoke with laura just after sending this and she is looking at it today . however , she indicated also that rob milnthorp had discussed a $ 7 mm number with louise . as you can see , the number we are proposing is significantly higher . i ' m sure i will be working with her on this tomorrow . just wanted to provide you with an update . please let me know any information you may hear from louise if rob circles back around with her .
thanks ,
edie
