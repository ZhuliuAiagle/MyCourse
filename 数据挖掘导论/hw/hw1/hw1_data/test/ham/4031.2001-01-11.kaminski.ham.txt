Subject: latest draft
vince ,
i have added a lot of material to " fill in the wholes " and would like your
reaction to the current draft . i am still not very happy with the risk
management segment ( primarily as a result of my own lack of knowledge ) so
please read it carefully and get me your comments .
i plan to let don chew ( the editor ) take a look at it to give us his
guidance toward a successful draft .
hope you are having a great day and tremendous start to the new year .
your friend
john
p . s . i really enjoyed your papers . those should definitely be part of a
class on risk management .
