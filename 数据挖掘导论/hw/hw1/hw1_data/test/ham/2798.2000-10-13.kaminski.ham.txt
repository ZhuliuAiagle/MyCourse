steve ,
i am calling anjam to give him a deadline regarding move to houston .
if he decides to stay in houston , you should meet with him to convey
the concerns regarding his performance .

subject : support for exotica
all
sharad ' s investigations of exotica ' s status in london have turned up a very
confused state of affairs . this isn ' t being helped by the fact that :
1 . anjam is rarely at his desk , and can ' t be found anywhere in the building .
2 . when he is around he isn ' t willing or able to provide all the information
sharad might need to support exotica .
this is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of
exotica ' s valuations .
sharad will now request information from anjam via email to leave a trail ,
and i want to alert you to the fact that sharad will be cc ' ing you in on
these emails .
if things don ' t improve soon , i may need to request some assistance in
extracting this information from anjam .
many thanks ,
steve
