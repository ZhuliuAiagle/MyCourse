louise ,
i appreciate your candid feedback .
my frustration was the unproductiveness of the events of friday and monday . if we could harness all the energy being utilized internally and redirect it to new business in our external markets , i believe we would have an unprecedented market advantage . i do understand some amount of politics is " a necessary evil " .
give me a call in chicago if we should discuss this further . i do not want this ordeal to reflect badly on myself or anyone else involved . i can be reached at 312 / 541 - 1225 . i depart around noon in my return to houston .

we have resolved the issue partly . john now reports directly to hunter . give me a ring to discuss . i felt your voicemail needed sorting out - you did sound annoyed , quite rightly so i think we have solved most of the problem .
by the way - give me a date and i ' ll be in chicago .
