i thought more about our phone conversation last night . based on what you said and assuming this document is ok , count me in . sorry my reaction was not as positive as you hoped but your comment about not being able to discuss who is on the team with anyone caught me off guard . i don ' t believe i have any issues with financial terms that you said ( again i want to see what it looks in writing ) . i still don ' t fully understand your reasons for handling this the way that you are but at the end of the day you are correct when you say that even if 50 % of the commercial people is all that we end up , this shop will still be better than any other on the street . i guess get me this document to look at when ever you can .
thanks ,
tom
