Subject: fw : netco ferc meetings
louise -
please see the attached below . it appears that the earliest we can visit with ferc is next thursday and friday ( as opposed to monday and tuesday ) . the ferc has a public meeting ( held every two weeks ) next wednesday and everyone runs around the building trying to get the orders finished .
also attached is a list of issues that netco will need to develop with the winning bidder to put in our ferc filing for market - based rate schedule .
thanks ,
jim

jim :
sam spoke with cindy marlet and they are aiming for thursday , january 17 . she said there was no way they could meet with netco before the commission meeting . cindy is checking with dan larcamp and mike coleman to see if they are available ( these are the two people she thinks we need to meet with ) . cindy also wants the meetings with the commissioner assistants to occur after the meeting with staff , so cindy will have to set up the meeting before we schedule with the assistants . we ' re waiting to hear back from cindy now .
i ' ll keep you posted .
by the way , i loved the marker picture and have sent it on to lots of other people .
