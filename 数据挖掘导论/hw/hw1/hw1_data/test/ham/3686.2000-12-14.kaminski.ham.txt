Subject: re : prc
dave ,
no problem . i shall do it this weekend .
also , i left you a message regarding grant masson ( a vp in my group
who left and went to work for el paso 2 months ago ) .
i made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year . i lost . he
wants to come back
after 2 months .
my recommendation is to take him back . he left on good terms and is quite
competent .
i would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other
side
of the fence may look greener , but in reality it may be painted hay . " the
return of grant
masson " would demonstrate that enron offers best long - term growth
opportunities ( and that
i am good manager ) .
grant would come back to his original vp position . can we short - circuit the
hiring procedures for a vp . grant ' s body is still warm and we can just
re - instate
him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required
to hire a vp .
