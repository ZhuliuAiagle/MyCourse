i have attached the general design we are proposing for the enron seminar
series mug . we have a little refinement to do - spacing here and there a
couple type - o ' s but this is the idea . if you like it , we will put an order
in .
i ' ll put out an announcement on the seminar schedule shortly . so far the
fall line up includes will goetzman - yale , lenard mirman - virgina , jeff
pontiff - u . of washington , george allyannis - darden , and charles lee -
