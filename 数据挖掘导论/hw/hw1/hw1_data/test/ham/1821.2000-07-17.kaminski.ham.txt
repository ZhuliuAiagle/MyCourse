Subject: pac reminder
last month you received an email about enrolling in the enron pac . the
response has been positive .
thank you to those of you that have already enrolled or made a change to your
current contribution !
if you have not had an opportunity to visit the enrollment site , please
consider taking a moment to do so . the link to the website is at the end of
this message .
some of you may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling .
we apologize for any trouble that you may have had . the enrollment works
best in either internet explorer or netscape . the most frequent problems
were a result of the lotus notes web browser that many employees have
installed as a default browser . if this is your case , please copy and paste
the link at the end of this message into either internet explorer or netscape .
as a reminder - following is the original message regarding the pac
enrollment :
last year the enron political action committee ( pac ) launched a campaign to
become a " million dollar pac " . enron employees , who provide all of the
funding for the pac , responded and the enron pac reached its objective ,
becoming one of the largest corporate pacs . this year we face a new
challenge . with the sale of eog , the announced sale of pge and normal
employee turnover , we have lost a significant number of consistent
contributors . we are seeking your support . if you are not a member , please
join . if you are a member , we hope you will consider increasing your
contribution .
the enron pac is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public
policy . our pac funds support local , state and federal candidates , of both
parties , who support open markets , deregulation and customer choice . amounts
contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with
federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the federal
election campaign act . while our pac has grown thanks to our employee
contributions , it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of
those who oppose these ideals .
this year , as always , we face challenges and opportunities for every one of
our businesses , including such issues as taxation and regulation of
e - commerce , electric industry restructuring , regulation of derivatives ,
international trade and investment legislation , pipeline safety , local and
state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants and
a variety of environmental and tax issues . enron has a long and successful
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy . that track
record depends on access to and regular communication with , decision makers .
the pac provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters care
about what they are doing .
one of the best things about enron is that we don  , t just take things as they
are . we challenge the status quo . we ask why . we change things . the pac
helps us do that . we need you to help the pac . sign up today  ) and please
