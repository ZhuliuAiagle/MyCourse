dear shirley ,
thank you so much for your email . after carefully considering my career
goals , i feel the associate program with a rotation in the enron
research group is a better fit . i am really interested in enron and i
would try to contact your colleagues in the associate program about this
issue before i schedule an interview with the enron research group . i
truly apologize for the inconvenience caused and i want to thank you
again for your kind assistance .
regards ,
kin tso

subject : interview with the enron research group
good morning kin :
your resume was forwarded to the research group with enron north
america and they would like you to come in for an informal
interview
sometime next week . the following dates and times are available
within
our group . please let us know if either of these two dates fit
your
schedule .
monday , november 6 th :
8 : 00 am to 11 : 30 am
friday , november 10 th :
8 : 00 am to 11 : 30 am
since we prefer these interviews to begin at 8 : 00 am , it would
probably
be best if you came the night before , spent the night at a hotel
downtown
and then were able to be at the enron bldg by 8 : 00 am . please
let me
know if this is what you would like to do and we will make the
hotel
reservation .
i look forward to hearing from you .
