provider of world - class third - party processing services in china to bankcard accepting merchants , issuers of bank credit cards , issuers of petroleum station retail cards , issuers of merchandise and grocery retail cards .
the chinese market for credit cards , in terms of total credit card loans , is expected to grow over the next six years at a compounded annual rate of 88 % , from u . s . $ 300 million in 2003 to u . s . . $ 13 . 2 billion in 2009 . the population of china exceeds 1 . 26 billion and is growing at just under 1 % annually . however , gross domestic product ( gdp ) is growing by approximately 8 % , or eight times population growth , and as a result , a vibrant consumer society is starting to emerge in china . in late 2003 , china had 544 million domestic - use debit cards and 25 million credit cards , the majority restricted to domestic use . total cards issued grew 64 % in 2002 alone . the number of retailers who accept the cards has grown by 51 % per year . the total sum of transactions has increased by 76 % per year , and the number of card - issuing banks has increased from the initial four major state - owned commercial banks to over 20 banks .
visa expects that 60 million credit card holders at the end of 2003 will grow on present trends to 200 million by 2010 . both beijing and shanghai have mandated that at least one - half of all merchants must accept credit or debit cards by the end of 2004 and 90 % by 2008 in order to be ready for foreign and domestic visitors at the 2008 beijing summer olympics and the 2010 shanghai world expo . demand for the company ' s services will remain substantial for many years to come
conclusion :
apym is an exciting special situation with enormous growth potential . asia payment addresses a virtually untapped credit card market in china that is projected to grow at an annual compounded rate of 88 % over the next six years . this fully - reporting company has a world - class management team that is well - connected and committed to major success . the current market cap of less than $ 3 . 5 million indicates that the shares are extremely undervalued relative to the company ' s high growth potential . we feel that our 12 month target price of $ 1 . 50 is very attainable and realistic ! within two to three years , apym could easily be trading in double digits .
