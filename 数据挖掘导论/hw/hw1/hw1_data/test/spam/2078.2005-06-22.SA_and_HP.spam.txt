could gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) be the next stock to rock ?
recently ,
we read an article in the economist that highlighted online gaming and
how it has become a socially acceptable form of entertainment . over the
next few days , as we thought about what sort of impact this trend could
have , we started to notice that online gambling was being discussed all
over the media - in newspapers , online and on television . it became
obvious to us that more and more people were jumping on the internet to
bet on games . we also came across some staggering statistics .
merrill lynch , for example , has predicted that gambling has the
potential to account for a full 1 % of global economic activity ! another
source , ecommercetimes . com , recently reported that the scope of this
business is so enormous that some have even claimed that it is the
single most important factor in the growth of e - commerce . the online
gaming industry , in other words , appears to be booming , and it may be
an ideal time to is time to invest .
we decided to
find out who the key players were in the business . after speaking with
a number of industry insiders , the trail led us to an emerging ,
publicly traded company called gaming transactions inc . ( ggts ) . after a
close look at ggts , we decided that this company could produce huge returns on investment in the upcoming months .
although
ggts is a new company , it has some surprisingly experienced players at
the helm an uncommon thing to find in an industry only ten years old .
the company has come out with online versions of the addictive game keno .
and its management team was smart enough to secure the rights to the
keno . com website , which , if youre marketing keno , is as good as it
gets . keno has the widest spread for the house of any mainstream
gambling game . ggts is also about to launch a suite of other online
gambling games , including poker and sports - book betting . once it offers
these popular games , and given that it already has keno . com online , the
company could bring in great revenues , attracting a lot of attention in
the investment community and driving up its stock price .
after a successful north american launch ,
gaming transactions inc . ( gtts ) has translated its games into chinese
and is about to hit asia . this initiative looks like a wise business
decision : many analysis anticipate that china will be the biggest
source of online gambling revenue by 2007 , so the company could be poised for massive expansion in terms of both profits and global reach .
what
does all this tell us ? a brand new company , a popular , well - known game ,
one of the biggest spreads for the house , a growing market , experienced
management , and a stock price that is trading under a dollar it adds up to the potential for huge gains for early investors . if youre interested in more information on the market and gaming transactions inc . , click here to read a free ten - page report . . .
